<head>Opening Address for Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau Dinner at Plaza Hotel</head>
<p>We are here tonight to celebrate a birthday.  The <org>Birth Control Clinical Research
Bureau</org> has just entered the seventh year of its existence.  In the six years of its existence
the Research Bureau V commonly called the<org> Birth Control Clinic</org>&ndash; has
demonstrated the success of a new way of solving old problems.</p>
<p>Just about one hundred years ago, when the possibilities of the control of population first
seized the minds and the imagination of the Anglo&hyphen;Saxon world, pioneers like <person>Francis
Place</person> and <person>John Stuart Mill</person>, thought that all that was necessary
was to scatter millions of leaflets to the masses telling them why and how they could prevent
large families.  A century ago men put great faith in the printed word.  They scattered leaflets
from the roofs of tenements and defied arrest for scattering broadcast \&ldquo;<socalled>diabolical
handbills</socalled>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, when the idea of Birth Control captured my imagination I went through
the same experience and wrote, printed and disseminated leaflets and booklets.  I was stopped by
the Post Office Authorities and indicted for breaking a federal statute enacted under the reign of <person>St. Anthony Comstock</person>.</p>
<p>But experience is a bitter teacher.  The more you go through, the less you believe in the
miracle of printed words to effect the salvation of the lives of women and children.  </p>
<p>In 1915 I visited <place>Holland</place>, and spent three months studying the actual
technique of contraception.  I became convinced that that overburdened women could be
educated in Birth Control only by scientific instruction received from competent physicians and
nurses in clinics established for that purpose and that purpose alone.</p>
<p>When I returned to this country, that idea was the central one in my mind.  I did not realize
the gigantic obstacles to overcome before that idea could be converted in reality.  I plunged into
activity, established a clinic in the Brownsville section of <place>Brooklyn</place>.  We
operated for ten days and no less than four hundred and eighty eight mothers crowded into our
limited quarters.  Then the police descended upon us and called us a\ &ldquo;<socalled>public
nuisance</socalled>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I carried this fight to the Supreme Court.  In a decision handed down by the <org>New
York Court of Appeals</org> permitted lawfully practising physicians to give contraceptive
advice \&rdquo;<q>for the cure of prevention of disease.</q>&rdquo; This technical victory was won in
1918.  With the aid of a woman physician I ventured on my own responsibility to establish a
research bureau as a preliminary toward a clinic.  In the meantime a small group of pioneers was
working incessantly toward converting unintelligent public opinion to the legitimacy of the idea
of Birth Control.</p>
<p>It was not until 1923&ndash; just six years ago&ndash; that I succeeded in finding anyone with sufficient
faith and courage to support the research bureau with financial backing.  Now Ill tell you an
interesting little secret.  It was not an American, but a gentleman in <place>England</place>
who advanced the first five thousand dollars to pay the doctor&rsquo;s salary.  That was all I needed.  I
found a competent physician.  The research bureau was opened.</p>
<p>From that small beginning, the bureau has grown slowly, steadily and surely.  Today we
have seven women physicians on our medical staff, five trained nurses and two social workers.</p>
<p>We have investigated thirteen thousand cases.  From that vast number we have the full
records of ten thousand women who came to the bureau for advice and instruction as permitted
under the law,\ &ldquo;<q>for the cure of prevention of disease.</q>&rdquo; Hundreds of overburdened
mothers who appeal to us are turned away because despite their misery and poverty do not come
under this classification.</p>
<p>Since my first clinic was destroyed by the <org><place reg="New York City, NY">New York</place> police</org>, the idea has gown and matured not only in this country but in <place>Great Britain</place> as well.  There are not twenty&hyphen;six similar establishments in this country and about
twenty in England.  Our aim here is to develop the Clinical Research Bureau as a model of all
other similar agencies in the <place>United States</place>.  In this aim we are succeeding. 
Physicians from all civilized countries of the world come to us to learn the techniques of
scientific contraception.  We are aiming to perfect the bureau so that its methods and its
administrations shall be above criticism. </p>
