<p><add>Thousands of women have already been greviously wounded in the battle of life&hyphen;&hyphen;Emergency measures are all they ask&hyphen;&hyphen;& all they are allowed to receive.  Week after week, day
after day & hour after hour they come to us, appealing & praying for help.  Some of them come
looking furtively about, hesitant wondering how they shall be received.</add></p>
<p><add>They have run the gamblet of various organizations & been denied the information
they sought.</add></p>
<p><add>They come to us, troubled, inarticulate, like doomed souls crushed beneath the force
of a cruelly prolific nature.</add></p>
<p><add>These are the martyrized Mothers of <place reg="United States">America</place>.  They ask for
help&hyphen;&hyphen;for the right to life, liberty & the pursuit of happiness.  </add></p>
<p><add>Temple of Motherhood.</add></p>
<p><del>The</del> Many critics of the Birth Control movement have failed to recognize
how closely the well&hyphen;being of children is related <del>upon</del> to the well&hyphen;being and
happiness of their mothers.  To protects the children we must also protect the Mothers.  It is now
my great honor to introduce a man who has fought long and bravely for the rights of <del>American</del> children <del>born in America</del><add>to be free</add>, <del>and
who has the insight and the courage to recognize that their first inalienable right is the right to be
well&hyphen;born.  It is my pleasure to introduce</del> <add>and</add> the leader in the long fight
against Child Labor&hyphen;&hyphen;Mr. Owen Lovejoy.</p>
