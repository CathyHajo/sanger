		<head>FREE-THINKING EDITOR DEFIES GOVERNMENT TO SUPPRESS HER PAPER</head>
		<p>"I intend to continue making public my ideas through my paper if I have to go to jail for
			it."</p>
		<p><q who="NYJ">This was the defiant statement made today by Mrs. Margaret Sanger, of 34
				Post avenue, editor and publisher of "<title type="journal">The Woman
				Rebel</title>," a monthly paper which the Federal authorities have just decided is
				unmailable. Deputy Attorney-General <person reg="Lamar, William H.">W. H.
					Lamar</person> had communicated the <place reg="Washington, DC"
					>Washington</place> decision to the New York post office.</q></p>
		<p>"No Gods, no masters," <q who="NYJ">is the motto of "<title type="journal">The Woman
					Rebel</title>," which, Mrs. Sanger says, is published for </q>"an advanced,
			thinking frankly speaking feminine clientele"</p>
		<p><q>Mrs. Sanger's pet theory is voluntary motherhood, and she believes that large families
				among the poor are responsible for many of the present-day evils.</q></p>
		<p>"Inform the working people and you will place a great weapon in their hands" she declared
			to-day to an <title type="journal">Evening Journal</title> reporter. It is a woman's
			duty to have an ideal and to speak and act in defiance of conventions.</p>
		<p>"Over on the other side, I noticed the difference in the manner in which children are
				<unclear resp="MSPP">raised</unclear> In <place>Scotland</place> you see a woman
			with a flock of children at her heels crying for bread. In almost all of the cities,
			children are treated as dogs and not as individuals. In <place>France</place>, where it
			is lawful to give out information of this character, everyone seems glad to have
			children, but not too many of them. Every encouragement is given to childbirth.</p>
		<p>"Over here we seem to have no consideration for children. We breed them wholesale,
			especially in the poorer sections of the city where children amount to no more than dogs
			in the street. </p>
		<p>"I believe that woman has been enslaved by the machinery of the world, by sex
			conventions, by motherhood, by wage slavery, by middle-class morality, by superstition,
			and by custom. Too many children in a poor family mean starvation and children that are
			of no account."</p>
		<p><q who="NYJ">Mrs. Sanger belongs to the <org reg="Industrial WOrlkers of the World"
					>I.W.W.</org>
				<person reg="Goldman, Emma">Emma Goldman</person> is one of the contributors to her
				paper.</q></p>
