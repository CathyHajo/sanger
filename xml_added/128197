<head>Introduction for <person>Henry Pratt Fairchild</person></head>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that Birth Control is no mere matter of overburdened mothers with babes in
their arms and hungry children tugging at their skirts.  It is a problem which affects the whole
world&hyphen;&hyphen;politics, industry, immigration, and all grave international problems.  In 1927 there
gathered in Geneva a large group of authorities on these problems&hyphen;&hyphen;<add>300</add>  scientists
and historians from <del>all</del><add>many</add> countries.  One of them read an
illuminating and masterly paper on \&ldquo;<socalled>optimum Population</socalled>&rdquo; which
received more attention from the press of <place>Europe</place> than any other paper present
at the <org>World Population Conference</org> <del>of 1927</del>.  I <del>am</del><add>was</add> proud that the author of this paper is <add>was</add> an American
resident of <place reg="New York City, NY">New York</place>, and the professor of <del>sociology</del><add>economics</add> at <org>New York University</org>.  And I am even prouder of the fact
that he has lent his prestige and his presence to this  gathering tonight.  I have the great honor of
introducing Dr. <add>Henry Pratt</add>  Fairchild.</p>
