		<head>BIRTH-CONTROL PROGRESS TOLD</head>
		<head type="sub">
			<person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> Reports on Educational
			Strides</head>
		<p>
			<q who="LAT">In spite of the storm of opposition which has raged around the subject of
				birth control, remarkable progress is being made in the matter of education,
				according to Mrs. Margaret Sanger, outstanding champion of the movmement in this
				country who is a guest at the <org reg="Ambassador Hotel">Ambassador</org>.</q></p>
		<p> “Prejudices are being broken down rapidly,” she said, “and while public opposition has
			died down to a large extent, unfortunately there still is much organized opposition.
			Education concerning the necessity for birth control is the basis of our whole problem
			and then we must have recognition of the movement by governments in order that birth
			control information will come under the jurisdiction and direction of qualified
			persons.</p>
		<p> Poor women, for instance, must have places where they can go to receive scientific
			instruction."</p>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">IMPORTANCE CITED</head>
			<p>“It is important that this movement should make progress, for I believe that
				civilization soon will be swamped if the birth-control movement fails. It is a fact
				that there is a larger percentage of incompetents being born now because there is a
				larger number of them reproducing.”</p>
			<p><q who="LAT">In this connection Mrs. Sanger said many of the countries of
						<place>Europe</place> are looking toward <place>California</place> with
					great interest to see what will be the results and effects of the State’s
					sterilization law, which is quite generally regarded, she asserts, as one of the
					greatest forward strides in legislation in the direction of humanitarianism.</q>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head type="sub">STUDENT ATTITIDE</head>
			<p>
				<q who="LAT">Mrs. Sanger said it has been her experience when attending conferences
					of college students on the subject of birth control that mixed groups approach
					the subject from a purely scientific angle, with an utter lack of
					self-consciousness.</q>
			</p>
			<p><q who="LAT">At the present time Mrs. Sanger's chief concern is the passage of the
						<org reg="United States Senate">Senate</org> bill designed to amend the
						<name reg="United States Criminal Code, Section 211" type="law">Comstock
						law</name> which first came into existence about sixty years ago. Through
					the proposed amendment the <place>United States</place> mail or common carriers
					would be available for members of the medical profession to distribure
					information.</q></p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<head>PURPOSE OF VISIT</head>
			<p><q who="LAT">Mrs. Sanger's purpose in Los Angeles is to appear at the hearing on the
					estate of the late <person reg="Kauffman, Viola">Viola Kauffman</person>, who,
					following her dealth last March, was found to have left considerable money and
					securities hidden away, although she had been considered a pauper. In her will a
					bequest was made to Mrs. Sanger's cause.</q></p>
			<p><q who="LAT">Following her experiences as a trained nurse in <place
						reg="New York, NY">New York</place>, Mrs. Sanger first began her crusade for
					the birth-control movement in 1916. In 1923 she established a <org
						reg="Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau">clinic</org> in New York in
					which since that time, 32,000 women have received instruction, she said. A large
					percentage of this number, she explained, have been young women in their
					twenties, who already are the mothers of four or five children.</q></p>
