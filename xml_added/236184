<head>The Population Problem</head>
<p><add>A number of</add><del>The</del> intelligent thinkers in <place>Europe</place>, many with whom I ha <del>d</del><add>ve</add> conversed, believe that the
empty spaces on the globe are becoming rare; that populations are so increasing in every country
that governments are at a loss to know how to deal with the problems arising there from; that
Europe is today faced with a problem of having more men than bread, and this problem has
become acute, because of the attitude of <place>United States</place>, <place>Australia</place> and <place>Canada</place> <add>as expressed</add>in their recent immigration
legislation.</p>
	
<p>It is now recognized that each <add>European</add> country needs its own
available food supply.  Each country is guarding its own labor market, fearing unrest,
unemployment and revolution.  Soon <emph rend="uline(yes)">every</emph> nation will reserve its potential
resources for its own people, and already most of the European countries have overdrawn on
their margin of self&hyphen;sufficiency.  <place>Germany</place>, <place>Italy</place> <place>Poland</place> and all the central European countries should be encouraged to limit their
population to their natural resources, <emph rend="uline(yes)">but they</emph> are all dreaming of colon<del>ization</del><add>ies</add>, for colonization over seas was the solution of
overpopulated Europe since the conquest of the Atlantic.</p>
	
<p>There is no doubt that this has made civilization almost worldwide, and yet, there
are doubts that this solution was of permanent value, for we now see that economic greed caused
nations to overlook fundamental principles, and the future potentialities of  <del>actions</del>
<del><add>peoples</add></del> have been sacrificed for <add>personal</add>
immediate gain.</p>
	
<p>Colonial expansion is still the dream of those militarists who clamor for big
battalions of babies, and we see from the past that colonization has aroused a hatred of peaceful
nations against the white race, and every where in <place>Asia</place> is the growing
determination to free themselves form the<del>ir</del> political domination <add>of the
white race</add>.</p>
	
<p>It had long been hoped by some of us, that <add>at sometime</add> a sound
international population program might be advanced.  We ha<del>ve</del> <add>d</add>
seen that a broader bird&rsquo;s eye view of the problem was necessary if it was to fit international and
modern conditions.  It <del>was</del><add>is</add> quite natural that the militarist should
look upon the subject only with a view of armies; the demographer with the number of births,
deaths, marriages in a given city, country over a given period.</p>
	
<p>The anthropologist <emph rend="uline(yes)">is concerned</emph> with the division into races,
within a population, especially in respect to their adaptability and the effect of social selection
and colonization; while the economist, biologist and statistician&ndash; each expert in his own line&ndash;
was bound to <add>view the subjects</add> to propose measures according to the limits of his
inquiries; consequently, formidable errors were bound to arise when it came to practical issues.</p>
	
<p>It was with this in mind that I went to Europe <del>for</del> <add>two years
ago with</add> the object of bringing together scientists form various countries of different
departments to correlate their views, experiments and programs, and to establish, if possible, a
permanent organization for further studies and research along population lines.</p>
	
<p><del>The</del>  <add>A</add> Population Union has now been launched and
it is hoped that there will be a recognition through their studies, of the fact, that there can be no
solution to the population problem without <del>the</del> recogn<del>ition</del><add>izing</add> <del>of</del> the human factors which make this problem.  I refer to the parents
who produce populations&ndash; and especially the mothers who bear and rear the children.</p>
