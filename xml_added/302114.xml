        <head>A NEW BOOK.</head>
        <p>“<title>The Age of Reason</title>” is a delightful book. Every
            chapter leaves you thinking, guessing, pondering, until the end when
            it finishes with a masterly climax. Many references to Birth Control
            are made throughout in a friendly spirit.</p>
        <p>The book brings your thinking up-to-date, and presents you with
            charming characters who fascinate as well as irritate.</p>
        <p>Those with a scientific trend of thought will enjoy is fully, but it
            is good reading for all. The conflict of science and religion goes on
            in a family of biologists, the father of which is married to the
            daughter of a clergyman.</p>
