                Work during the year was concentrated on: (1) inclusion of
                pregnancy spacing in more State Health Departments; (2)
                stimulation of adequate teaching of contraception in medical
                schools and wider distribution to physicians, of a condensed

                pregnant. Medical Officers of Health were reported as
                cooperating, in many countries by referring cases to clinics for
                advice. Elsewhere in <place>Europe</place> no information
