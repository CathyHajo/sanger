<head>The Boy Scout Movement </head>
<p>About five years ago an organization was started in <place>England</place> called \&ldquo;<soCalled>The Boy Scouts</soCalled>&rdquo;. It was originated by <name>Mr. Baden Powell</name> during the Boer War. It was very quickly imported to <place>America </place>and
seized upon most enthusiastically by America&rsquo;s grown up boy scout, <person>Theodore
Roosevelt</person>. </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<soCalled>Delighted</soCalled>&rdquo; indeed was he to <supplied resp="MSPP">fasten</supplied> this
military idea upon the American people, and together with the <org reg="Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA)">Young Mens Christian
Ass&rsquo;n</org> and the <org reg="Young Mens Hebrew Association (YMHA)">Young Mens Hebrew Ass&rsquo;n</org> they grasped this new <supplied resp="MSPP">prop</supplied>, which will in time of need, help to keep the Capitalist Class and
private property a little longer standing.</p>
<p>A great deal of opposition was met with in this country at first because mothers objected to
military training given to their sons, but behold &ndash; this objection <supplied resp="MSPP">will</supplied>
soon overcome, voices shouted from the house tops that this was \&ldquo;<quote><gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> its essence 
strictly non&hyphen;military movement</quote>&rdquo;, that the real idea <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> the organization is to
develop <supplied resp="MSPP">the</supplied> individuality of the boy. One of the essential laws of the <org reg="The Boy Scouts">Boy Scouts</org> <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> that he shall \&ldquo;<soCalled>show respect to those who are his
superiors</soCalled>&rdquo;. Now <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> to the individuality let us see just how they go about to
develop <gap reason="torn " extent="one word"> \&ldquo;<quote>To be a boy scout, a boy must learn to <emph rend="case(allcaps)">obey</emph> the
orders of <supplied resp="MSPP">the</supplied> patrol leader, scout master, and scout commissioner.</quote>&rdquo; </p>
<p>He must learn to obey before <gap reason="torn " extent="one word"> can command. He should so <supplied resp="MSPP">learn</supplied> to discipline and control <supplied resp="MSPP">himself</supplied> that he will have <emph rend="case(allcaps)">no thought</emph> but to <emph rend="case(allcaps)">obey</emph> the Orders of this Officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Baden Powell on a visit <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> this country in February still insisted that the whole
object of the Organization is to develop \&ldquo;<soCalled>Individual character and initiative</soCalled>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let us go on a little further <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> the by&hyphen;laws, for far be it from us <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> judge without
proof. \&ldquo;<quote>A scout <gap reason="torn" extent="one word"> loyal to the King, to his Officers, to his County and to his <supplied resp="MSPP">Employers</supplied>. &ndash; <emph rend="case(allcaps)">this is the very <supplied resp="MSPP">essence</supplied>
of good citizenship</emph></quote>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote>A Scout obeys Orders to anyone placed in authority over him, must obey orders <emph rend="case(allcaps)">instantly</emph><supplied resp="MSPP">and </supplied><emph rend="case(allcaps)">without question</emph></quote>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These rules and by&hyphen;laws should settle the question of the individuality any boy can develop
in the Boy Scout Movement. Many parents against are appealed to through the camp life which
the boy can lead. The boys themselves having only one glorious idea of freedom in the woods,
pictures of running streams, lovely forests, tramping, running, playing, good companions, and a
lot of good fun, all of which appeals to any healthy boy at this critical period of his development.
Hundreds of boys answer to this call of out&hyphen;door life just as thousands answer the call of the sea
and enlist in the <org>Navy</org>, where in glowing colors trips in <place>China</place>
and <place>Japan</place> and all Countries are viewed to them. To catch the young men in
their \&ldquo;<soCalled>down and out</soCalled>&rdquo; financial state, imagination does the rest and off
they go to join the Navy. In Powell&rsquo;s own words he says: \&ldquo;<quote who="POWBA">To seize the boys character
in its red hot state of enthusiasm</quote>&rdquo;. That has been the idea of the <org>Catholic
Church</org> too, they understand the value of influence at this crucial age. How cowardly and
base to take advantage of the undeveloped youth, to use him, to mold his life and actions for the
benefit of their class: the Master Class. There is only one step from the boy scout to the <org>Army</org>. This has been foreseen and planned by all who support it, and it behooves all who
are far sighted enough to see and understand the real significance of this movement, to attack it,
to crush it and stamp it out for once and all. We should lay more stress on the underlying motive
of this fiendish organization, and expose it. We are not doing our duty to the Working Class
when we calmly sit by and watch this movement grow into an army. It has increased in <place>United States</place> in the last four years at a tremendous rate, it is increasing daily, and it is
time for the working class to <emph rend="case(allcaps)">act</emph>.</p>
<p>Wherever the Church is, they are organizing, there they find fertile soil. They are joining
their forces for the final battle, and we are allowing them to do so without a murmur. There are
over 40000 boys in this country being trained to scab on the working class, there are over 40,000
boys in this Country being trained to murder the Working Class. </p>
<p>The following speaks for itself:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote>Accordingly &ndash; Employers of labor seeking trustworthy boys service will look
first among scouts, knowing that they will find boys broken to discipline</quote>&rdquo;. </p>
<p>And yet in the face of all these remarks and statement issued by Powell himself, they try to
fool parents by saying it is a movement to develop ideas in a healthy mind. In the first annual
report of the Boy Scout by Powell, he states: &ndash;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="POWBA">Appreciation from a Chief Constable who states that the boy scouts in a town
are worth 20 extra constables to him</quote>&rdquo;. Should there still be a mother who doubts the
real intention of the movement, let her read the message from <person reg="Edward VIII (king of England)">King Edward</person>
to the boys at their first Annual parade.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="ED8">Please assure the boys that the King takes great interest in them, and that if he
should call upon them later in life, their sense of patriotic responsibility and happy discipline,
which they are now acquiring as boys will enable them to do their duty as men, should any
danger threaten the Empire</quote>&rdquo;. The two words \&ldquo;<soCalled>patriotic responsibility</soCalled>&rdquo; are plain enough for anyone to understand and don&rsquo;t let the \&ldquo;<soCalled>happy
discipline</soCalled>&rdquo; escape your notice. Think it over. The Capitalists have had much to
contend with in the last few years in finding the two essentials, patriotism and discipline, fast
dying out. They realize that the species which exhibit a trace of patriotism is almost extinct, and
the growing youth does not love discipline &ndash; consequently they invent a new kind of discipline &ndash;
a happy one &ndash; and with this they feed the scouts. </p>
<p>Too well to do they realize that it is not the love of country which sends young men into the
Army or Navy, but absolute necessity drives thousands of others into the factories. Too well they
know this, and knowing they cannot instill patriotism into the man &ndash; they take a chance on the
boy and take him before he begins to think &ndash; then they have for their motto \&ldquo;<quote>I do not
think &ndash; I obey</quote>&rdquo;. </p>
<p>It is all the same to the Capitalist to what use they put the children of the workers &ndash; millions
into human machines &ndash; and millions would they gladly put into the army to develop into human
murderers.</p>
<p>Parent, your duty is plain &ndash; develop in your child a <emph rend="case(allcaps)">contempt</emph> for soldiers
in uniform: a contempt for anyone would train in the art of murder: a contempt for anyone who
prances up and down monkey like at the orders of another. Teach him the words of <person>George Kirkpatrick</person> who says \&ldquo;<quote who="KIRGE">I refuse to kill my father, or my sisters, sweet
heart, I refuse to kill any member of the working class and hide my blood stained hands in the
folds of <emph rend="case(allcaps)">any flag</emph>.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
