<head rend="case(allcaps)">Birth Control in <place>America</place>.</head>

<p>There appears to be a movement on foot at present in America which if successful will be
the first vital step toward the overthrow of Puritanism, as well as the slow but certain downfall of
Comstockery in that country.  It is the Birth Control movement, and it has grown so rapidly in
favour and strength during the past few months that in <place>New York City</place> alone
there are two separate Birth Control Leagues &hyphen;&hyphen; one consisting of members of the medical
profession, and the other mainly of feminists and people of feminist sympathies.</p>

<p>It is now over forty years since there were placed on the Statute Book of the United States
Government laws rushed through an uproarious and hurried <org>Congress</org> in the last
hour of March 3 (new Administrations assume duties March 4), known as the \&ldquo;<soCalled>Comstock Laws</soCalled>,&rdquo; which prohibited any matter passing through the mails which, in
the opinion of <person>Anthony Comstock</person>, was \&ldquo;<soCalled>obscene</soCalled>.&rdquo;  This implied a religious as well as moral opinion.</p>

<p><person>Robert G. Ingersoll</person> and his followers arose at once to strike a deadly
blow at the religious part of the law, and succeeded so well that a few years later the law was
modified, and religious prejudice was removed.  Let it be understood that it was not removed
from the Statute Book until after there was no use for it.  Ingersoll&rsquo;s propaganda against the
Church and religion was so effective and widespread that by direct action, and education, he
undermined the Church at its very foundation, and left the stupid law hanging in <place>Washington</place> like the dried shell of a tortoise.  When there was no use or no further
interest in the law, the lawmakers secretly removed that portion of it.  But they tightened their
grip harder than ever on the moral side of it, and in case the word \&ldquo;<soCalled>obscene</soCalled>&rdquo; should be too vague, they stipulated its meaning, and combined the causing of
abortion and the prevention of conception under one title, \&ldquo;<soCalled>obscene</soCalled>,&rdquo;
and threatened five years&rsquo; imprisonment and a five&hyphen;thousand dollar fine for any one who was
found guilty of this offence.  The consequence has been that though many have broken it by
sending through the mail papers, magazines, etc., with nude figures in their pages, and have been
prosecuted for \&ldquo;<soCalled>obscenity</soCalled>,&rdquo; only one besides myself has openly defied
this outrageous law on the prevention of conception.  This was <person>Dr. Elliot</person>,
an honoured member of the medical profession, who, seeing the suffering of poor and miserable
women, stated he would defy the law and give out this information to those who needed it.  A
few days later he received two letters from different towns asking for his advice &hyphen;&hyphen; one writer
saying she was the mother of nine children and had a syphilitic husband, the other saying she had
ten children and a husband out of work through illness.  Dr. Elliot sent the necessary information
to both writers.  The following week he was arrested, dragged off to gaol, and confronted by a
woman, a Comstock spy, as the one who had written to him in both cases.  He was tried, found
guilty, and sentenced to five years in the <org>Leavenworth Penitentiary</org> for <emph rend="slant(italic)
">each</emph> letter, and a ten&hyphen;thousand dollar fine.  He got the limit of the law.  He served six
years, but through some agitation recently aroused, he has been \&ldquo;<soCalled>pardoned</soCalled>,&rdquo; and allowed to go free.</p>

<p>Broken in health and spirit, with his professional standing practically gone, his case has
stood like a giant rock for the authorities, and held the medical profession and others alike at bay.</p>  

<p>I had no desire to become a martyred Dr. Elliot, but I harboured a burning desire to
undermine that law, not by waiting to vote it out of existence, but by crushing it out by action, for
direct action will bring results that a generation of political action could never do.</p>

<p>In March, 1914, I brought out a monthly paper, the <title rend="slant(italic)">Woman Rebel</title>, which
had on its banner, \&ldquo;<quote>No Gods, No Masters,</quote>&rdquo; and had for its motto, \&ldquo;<quote>Working women, build up within yourselves a conscious fighting character against all things
which enslave you.</quote>&rdquo;  It claimed that women&rsquo;s first right is over her own body, to be a
mother or not as she saw fit; but such rights involved a knowledge of the means to prevent
conception.  The columns were thrown open for opinions, and letters poured in thick and fast
from all over America.  Seven out of nine issues were suppressed and confiscated by the
Government, and in August the Federal grand jury returned a verdict against me of three
indictments on twelve counts, or a liability of twelve years&rsquo; imprisonment.  But I had no intention
to undergo imprisonment for simply discussing a subject.  There was already printed, and waiting
in storage in various parts of the United States, a pamphlet giving direct information on family
limitation.  The authorities heard of this, and were anxious to push my trial on the pending
indictment, and hoped to frighten or discourage me from doing any further work on the subject. 
The trial came up in October, and I asked for a postponement to prepare my case.  The Judge
refused it, saying I had had time enough to prepare it.  I then took my own postponement, and left
for <place>Europe</place>.  Three days later there were one hundred thousand pamphlets on
family limitation passing through the mails into the various industrial sections of the country.  </p>

<p>The fact that I am a middle&hyphen;aged, motherly, harmless&hyphen;looking person, led the Judge to allow
me to go without bail, so that my leaving the country made the authorities quite furious.  They
cleverly laid a trap by sending a man calling himself a \&ldquo;<soCalled>comrade</soCalled>&rdquo; to
Mr. <person reg="Sanger, William ">Sanger</person>&rsquo;s studio.  This man showed great interest in my work, and after
a second call of friendly interest got Mr. Sanger to give him one of the pamphlets on \&ldquo;<title>Family Limitation</title>.&rdquo;  He left the studio, and in a few minutes returned with Anthony
Comstock, who had a warrant for Mr. Sanger&rsquo;s arrest, and a warrant to search his premises,
which was done.  </p>

<p>They then tried to induce him to tell of my whereabouts and my plans, on the promise of
leniency; failing that, he was taken to gaol and locked up until bail could be found for him.  His
case is still pending.  <org>The Free Speech League </org>has taken it up, and are trying to get
it tried before a jury.  It will no doubt be held over until the October Court opens.  A few weeks
following Mr. Sanger&rsquo;s arrest, some person or persons entered his studio, and a box of private
letters written to him by me from Europe were mysteriously missing.  </p>

<p>In the meantime a tremendous indignation swept the country at Mr. Sanger&rsquo;s arrest, and
brought with it an overwhelming interest in the subject of birth control.  At last the great
conspiracy of silence on this subject was broken, and the capitalist press took it up from all sides. 
One conservative daily has offered a prize of £5 for the best letter on the subject of family
limitation.</p>  

<p>As I near the conclusion of the work which I came to Europe to do, the thought naturally
comes to me, \&ldquo;<q>Shall I return to America, and stand trial for these indictments?</q>&rdquo;  We
who know the State and its machinery, know that it is not built upon reason, or justice or upon a
desire for human welfare.  We know it maintains its hold upon us by force, and for me to return
and expect to reason with a Government which knows no reason, seems a childlike act.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is the danger of this movement being transferred from the control
of the State to the control of the medical profession, which in reality is only an exchange of high
priests &hyphen;&hyphen; another Church which the workers must pass through with bended knees before they
can get to the knowledge that rightly belongs to them.  It is my desire that such knowledge should
be available to every adult man and woman, but especially to the <emph rend="slant(italic)">working</emph>
men and women.  </p>

<p>There have been so many letters come to me these last few weeks urging my return, and
requesting me to take up the working class side of the fight, and fight the case against a growing
tendency of class liberty and class privilege, that I have decided to return to America in the latter
part of the summer, and stand my trial. </p>

<p>I am not fooling myself by thinking that the same magazines and press which are
advocating the idea of birth control by legal means are going to stand behind any one who defied
and deliberately broke a sacred law and advocated it by direct means.  I know too well the
methods of the cowardly press, and expect little from them.  But in a country where there is the
latest scientific invention, and most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date machinery, if there exists by its side laws which
execute ideals, and burn at the stake those who dare to speak and act for freedom, then it is time
such places were exposed, and their much&hyphen;boasted freedom and liberty challenged.</p>
