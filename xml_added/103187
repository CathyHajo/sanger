        <p>"The absurd cruelty of permitting thousands of women every year to go through abortions
            to prevent the aggregation of diseases for which they are under treatment assuredly
            cannot go on much longer ignored by the medical profession," said Mrs. Sanger.
            "Responsibility for the inestimable done by the practice of permitting patients
            suffering from caertain ailments to become pregnant, because of their ignorace of
            contraceptives, when the physician knows that if pregnancy goes to its full term it will
            hasten the disease and lead to the patient's death, must in all fairness be laid at his
            door. </p>
        <p>What these diseases are and what dangers are onvolved in pregnancy are known to every
            practicioner of standing. Specialists have not been negligent in poinitng out the
            situation. Eager to enhance or protect their reputations in the profession, they
            continually call out to one another" "Don't let the patient bear a child--don't let
            pregnancy continue."</p>
        <p>The warning has been sounded most often, perhaps, in the cases of tubercular women.</p>
