<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+2">THE BIRTH-CONTROL RAID</font></div>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is my party!" shouted
Policewoman Mary Sullivan, in the midst of her personally conducted raid
on the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau in New York City, last week.
Subsequent developments have demonstrated that this boast was as premature
as it was untruthful.  For Policewoman Sullivan's little raiding party, carried
out with a vigor that swept aside as unnecessary such things as common courtesy
and ordinary good manners, has proved to be of vital interest to every thinking
member of this community.  And the end is not yet in sight. As I write these
indignant words, the announcement comes that Chief Magistrate William McAdoo
now admits that the police, in seizing the case histories of our patients,
had exceeded the scope of the search warrant he had issued authorizing this
raid--an act on their part which constitutes a misdemeanor.  </font></p>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After you have spent some fifteen
years, slowly and with infinite pains and patience working for the right
to test the value of contraceptive practice in a scientific and hygienic--and
lawful--manner, without interfering with the habits or the morals of those
who disagree with you, it is indeed difficult to submit with equanimity to
such brutal indignities as were gratuitously thrust upon us at the clinic
a week ago.  Compensations there have been, of course--mainly in the enlightened 
attitude of such dailies as the New York Herald Tribune and others, and the
generous offers of aid from distinguished physicians.  But even these can
scarcely counterbalance the evidence of the sinister and secret power of
our enemies.</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As in the breaking up of the
birth-control meeting in the Town Hall, in 1921, the raid on the Birth Control
Research Bureau gives us a glimpse of the animus which may direct the action
of the police.  In their futile efforts to annihilate a social agency which
had already been given a clean bill of health by the health department of
the municipality, by the state board of charities and by the Academy of Medicine,
our hypocritical antagonists have not the courage to fight us squarely, in
the open, but adopt the cowardly subterfuge of utilizing minor and crassly
ignorant members of the police force.  Our research bureau has been functioning
since 1923, operating within the law, and cooperating with recognized charitable
institutions.</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From whatever point of view
it is analyzed, Policewoman Sullivan's "party" was a deplorable failure.
 A failure, first of all, because it has exposed a complete lack of intelligence
in those who conducted it, and a woeful lack of coordination in the police
department itself.  It is not enough for Grover Whalen or District Attorney
Banton to disclaim all foreknowledge of the raid.  Modest as may be the headquarters
of the research bureau, it is highly significant and important.  Therefore,
to permit minor members of the police force, or hostile assistants in the
office of the District Attorney, to pass judgement upon its fate, denotes
either a lack of coordination of powers, or a bland carelessness in directing
them.  Certainly no official of the city government, cognizant of awakened
public opinion concerning the social value of contraception, and aware, moreover,
of the searching criticism to which the police department of New York City
is now subjected, would ever have chosen the present moment as one psychologically
suited to inaugurate a brutal raid upon a modest unadvertised clinic which
was functioning quietly and successfully in an obscure side street, minding
its own business and hoping that its powerful ecclesiastical neighbors would
mind theirs.  At a time when the criminal elements of the city--racketeers, 
gangsters, gunman and hijackers--are so active and successful, it would seem
to a bystander that all the intelligence, skill, and brawn of the force should
be mobilized and focused upon "crime control."</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even the thrill of satisfaction
we have had in the offers of distinguished doctors to testify in our behalf,
in the letters to the press, and the courageous outspoken editorials, cannot
obliterate the memory of Policewoman Sullivan standing in the clinic and
shouting vigorously and victoriously "This is my party!"  I would rather
forget that here was a woman fighting against other women who were devoting
their lives to succor and to save their fellow women.  By trickery and hypocrisy 
she had obtained her "evidence," and now she triumphantly commanded the doctors
and nurses into the waiting patrol wagons.</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whatever the outcome of this
raiding party, I hereby call upon the citizens of New York to find out for
themselves how and where it originated, and why it was carried out.  I ask
them to recall the breaking up by the police of the birth-control meeting
in Town Hall, with the subsequent revelation that this illegal action was
instigated by Roman Catholic ecclesiastical authorities.  We are paying,
and paying heavily, for the support of a great police force.  It is our right
and duty to insist that it shall function in an efficient, legal, and socially
effective manner. Policewoman Sullivan's "party" exposes it as operating
in a manner which suggests the gratification of private prejudices and unreasoning
emotion, rather than the even-handed administration of justice and the law.</font></p>
