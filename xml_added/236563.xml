            <p><person reg="Hugo, Victor">Victor Hugo</person>– <q who="HUGVI"
                    >No force in the world so great as that of an idea whose
                    hour has struck.</q> I believe that the hour for birth
                control has struck, because there is no subject that has so
                large a practical significance which at the same time cuts so
                deeply into the foundations of social evolution as birth
                control.</p>
            <p>There is probably no other subject of equal importance, left so
                long in equal obscurity &amp; yet none which can show so
                unequalled a rise on our National horizon as this question has
                done within the past few years.</p>
            <p>
                <person reg="Shaw, George Bernard">G B Shaw</person> says it's
                the <q who="SHAGE">most revolutionary idea of the present
                    century</q>
                <person reg="Wells, H. G.">HG. Wells</person> says <q
                    who="WELHG">it's the most momentous fact of modern
                life.</q></p>
            <p>The most intelligent English opinion of Church &amp; the
                professions have claimed it to be of <add>immediate
                </add>importance in solving the Social &amp; Economic problems
                of the world.</p>
            <p>Birth Control is the signal of a new Social &amp; Moral
                awakening. It is not only a health &amp; economic expedient it's
                a great Social principle, interlocked with the <add>future</add>
                development of women &amp; the spiritual progress of the race.
                Birth Control is the conscious control of the birth rate, by
                means that prevent the conception of life. The emphasism is
                placed on prevention &amp; not on interferrence or destruction
                of life.</p>
            <p> The emphasism is placed on Control &amp; not on limitation.</p>
            <p>It is also placed on conscious control instead of the reckless
                abandon to the moment with children the result. (haphazard,
                accidental conceptions) A generation ago it cost $10 to bring a
                baby into the world– today because we have limited the output
                &amp; placed a higher value on child life, we have increased its
                value &amp; prepared the way for its higher development.</p>
            <p> Birth Control will prevent children from being born to become
                    <hi rend="underlined">buffers</hi> between two discordent
                parents, or become victims of marriage, of immature persons who
                make chattels of them for their own personal satisfaction or
                exploit them as wage earners to support an increasingly large
                family.</p>
            <p>There are seven <add>obvious</add> reasons to practice birth
                control</p>
            <p> 1st When ever either man or woman has a transmissable disease.
                Insanity, feeblemindedness, epilepsy etc.</p>
            <p>2nd. When the woman has any disease in which pregnancy
                complicates the cure such as tuberculosis, heart or kidney
                diseases.</p>
            <p> 3rd- When parents tho aparently normal have already produced
                subnormal or defective children, deaf mutes, cleft palates,
                mental <unclear>defectives</unclear>.</p>
            <p> 4 To allow two or three years between births in order to space
                the children to give the mother a chance to recuperate &amp;
                prepare for the next child.</p>
            <p>5<hi rend="underlined">th</hi>. Birth control should be practiced
                until often the adolescent period is passed– even tho' early
                marriage is advised or councelled.</p>
            <p> 6<hi rend="underlined">th</hi> BC should be practiced for
                economic reasons– parents should not have more children than
                they can decently provide for.</p>
            <p>7<hi rend="underlined">th</hi>. BC should be practiced for two or
                three years after marriage in order to make a better adjustment
                &amp; to strengthen &amp; cement the marriage bond, through
                understanding &amp; knowledge of each other &amp; through the
                development of mutual <del>interests</del> play &amp; cultural
                interests.</p>
            <p> There are Three ways to control the birth rate or the size of
                the family.</p>
            <p> 1 Continence</p>
            <p> 2 Sterilization</p>
            <p>3 Chemical or mechanical means of preventing conception.</p>
            <p>None of these should be advised by laymen– not even the clergy.–
                all methods to be safe, reliable &amp; harmless must be
                individually considered by qualified persons with knowledge of
                psychology anatomy &amp; physiology.</p>
