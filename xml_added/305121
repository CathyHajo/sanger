<head>Should Women Know?</head>


<byline>(By <person rend="case(allcaps)">Margaret Sanger</person>).</byline>


<p>{<quote>We have devoted much attention in the past to <person>Richard Carlile</person>&rsquo;s struggle against the State allied to the \&ldquo;<soCalled>Vice Society</soCalled>.&rdquo; 
This historical work shall be returned at an early date.  Meanwhile we have much pleasure in
directing attention to the activities of the present infamous American counterpart and imitator of
the organisation that preyed on human ignorance here a century back.  We do not endorse all our
contributor&rsquo;s neo&hyphen;Malthusian reasoning however.</quote> &hyphen;&hyphen; <hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Ed</hi>.}.</p>



<p>When the <title>Constitution of the United States</title> authorised congress to establish
post offices and poste roads, it was not intended that the authority should go beyond this.  It did
not authorise it to censor the matter to be conveyed, nor to sit in judgement upon the moral, or
intellectual qualities of the printed matter or parcel entrusted to it to deliver.  The post office was,
primarily, a mechanical institution, not an ethical one, whose business was efficiency, not
religion or morality.</p>

<p>But with the rapid falling away of Church influence among the people in <place>United
States</place> within the last half century, it was necessary, if the Church would retain its hold
upon the people, to lay its hands upon them in some subtle way, in which they would not be
conscious of its power over them.  This was done in 1873, by the passing of laws commonly
known as the \&ldquo;<soCalled>Comstock Laws</soCalled>,&rdquo; which prohibit the sending of any
matter through the mails, which, according to the opinion or judgement of <person>Anthony
Comstock</person>, the Postal Authorities see fit to call \&ldquo;<soCalled>obscene</soCalled>.&rdquo;  </p>

<p>Anthony Comstock was born in 1844, which makes him seventy&hyphen;one years old next March. 
He has been Secretary and special agent for the <org>Society for the Suppression of Vice</org> since 1873 &hyphen;&hyphen; forty years &hyphen;&hyphen; and also Post Office Inspector since the same year.  Thus the
Church, not daring to come out and to interfere with moral or religious principle openly, hides
behind the closed doors of the \&ldquo;<soCalled>Suppression of Vice Society</soCalled>,&rdquo; and
works its poisonous way through the Government <emph rend="slant(italic)">via</emph> its special agent,
Comstock.  </p>

<p>Comstock records that he has destroyed 160 tons of literature, and brought 3,760 \&ldquo;<soCalled>criminals</soCalled>&rdquo; to \&ldquo;<soCalled>justice</soCalled>.&rdquo;  In 1878,
considerable agitation was aroused, and a petition presented to <org>Congress</org>, headed
by the name of <person>Robert Green Ingersoll</person>, to which was added those of 70,000
\&ldquo;<soCalled>freemen</soCalled>&rdquo; to repeal the laws known as the \&ldquo;<soCalled>Comstock
laws</soCalled>.&rdquo;  The petition measured over two&hyphen;thousand feet in length, and was placed on
file with the <org>House Committee on the Revision of Laws</org>.  It prayed for the \&ldquo;<quote>repeal or modification of certain laws executed ostensibly to prevent the passage of
obscene literature through the mails of the United States, but which laws have been and are being
enforced to destroy the liberty of conscience in the matter of religion, against the freedom of the
press, to the great hurt of the people,</quote>&rdquo; etc., etc.  Some years later the law was revised,
removing the interference of religious prejudice, but holding to moral interference and prejudice
more strongly than ever.  Since that time there have been several attempts by individuals or
groups to establish, and agitate for, freedom along moral lines.  Persecutions have followed,
especially when the agitations assumed printing form.  One man in <place reg="Chicago, IL">Chicago</place>,
well in the seventies, <person>Moses Haran</person>, edited a paper called <title rend="slant(italic)">Lucifer</title>, which came under the ban of this law.  He was sentenced to imprisonment, year after
year, but as soon as he came out of prison, he took up the fight again and again, for nearly ten
years, until finally his health gave way through his sufferings and imprisonment, and he passed
away.  Many other writers, editors, and publishers have come into direct conflict with this law. 
The quality and standard of literature must remain subservient to an old fossilized opinion or die. 
</p>

<p>Literature is not alone in this fight for its life &hyphen;&hyphen; for alas! even art is hampered by this law&rsquo;s
existence.  It is only a short time ago that the picture \&ldquo;<title>September Morn</title>,&rdquo; made
famous through Comstock suppression, was on exhibition in a window in <place>New York
City</place>.  It was the side&hyphen;figure of a little girl, seen bathing in a pool of water, and painted
in the nude; which so shocked the morals of Comstock that its removal was made necessary. 
Many other works of art, many magazines whose covers dare to exhibit an unclothed statue, are
suppressed and confiscated by the <org reg="United States Post Office">Post Office</org> through its special agent,
Comstock.</p>

<p>The latest and most flagrant disregard for the free press, was in the suppression and
confiscation of the monthly publication, <title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title>.  This was a working
woman&rsquo;s paper &hyphen;&hyphen; the first of its kind ever issued in America.  It carried on its banner \&ldquo;<quote>no gods, no masters.</quote>&rdquo;  It had for its motto, \&ldquo;<quote>Working women, build up within
yourself a conscious fighting character against all things which enslave you</quote>&rdquo;; and
advocated for the working class the knowledge of the means to prevent conception.  </p>

<p>Its first number, in March 1914, was suppressed.  The May, July, August, September, and
October issues were all suppressed and confiscated because of articles in the paper discussing the
importance of the workers controlling the size of their families.  One article, called \&ldquo;<title>Open Discussion</title>,&rdquo; was suppressed for discussing discussion of the subject.  Another
article, entitled \&ldquo;<title>The Birth Control League</title>,&rdquo; which announced the organisation
of the league, and its outline of agitation, was suppressed also.</p>

<p><title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title> did not advocate this knowledge, or the practice of this
knowledge as a \&ldquo;<soCalled>cure all</soCalled>&rdquo; for the workers from their present economic
enslavement, but it did urge the practice of it as the most important immediate step which they
should take toward their economic emancipation.  Too long have the workers produced slaves for
the enemy, children for the mills, soldiers and sailors for <place>Mars</place>.  The time has
come to cease at the fount of production, and watch the masters produce their own slaves for a
while.  </p>

<p>At least the working woman should have the right to say if she wishes to become a mother
or not.  The women of the upper class have that right, for they have that knowledge and the
money with which to purchase such knowledge.  But all obstacles are placed in the way for the
working man&rsquo;s wife to obtain this, and any means to free herself from constant child&hyphen;bearing.  </p>

<p><title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title> promised to give this knowledge to all who asked for it,
and urged the working women to rally to its support in this just cause.  The Federal Grand Jury
returned three indictments against the editor on twelve counts, eleven of which were merely a
discussion of the subject of birth control.  No information was given in the paper&rsquo;s columns, but
the very mention of the subject was considered obscene and entitled the editor to twelve years&rsquo;
imprisonment.  A year in the Federal penitentiary for every count, with the indictment for the
August, September, and October issues still pending.</p>

<p>It is quite natural and consistent with capitalist laws, that there should be a heavy penalty
for imparting this particular information among the workers, when we view these laws in the
light of our present&hyphen;day society.  Industry in the U.S.A. is comparatively new.  It is reaching out
in foreign lands to capture trade everywhere.  To do this, it must undersell its rival competitors,
and in order to undersell, it must make cheap goods, which, in turn, can be done only by cheap
labour.  The cheapest labour is that of women and children.  The larger the size of the family, the
earlier the children enter the factories.</p>

<p>There is a brilliant example of this in the cotton&hyphen;mills of the South, where little pale&hyphen;faced
children, nine and ten years of age, wend their weary way to the mills early in the winter
mornings, before the sun is up, and return, after twelve hours&rsquo; toil, after it has set.  These little
ones are just \&ldquo;<soCalled>helpers</soCalled>&rdquo; to their mothers, who work in the mills also,
while the father remains at home, cares for the younger children, and takes the noonday meal to
his wife and children in the mills.  The working people, in the cotton belt, average eight and nine
children to a family, as they do in other industrial sections where child labour exists and wages
run low.</p>

<p>Almost all of the stock&hyphen;holders of these mills are legislators, congressmen, etc., who have
much to do in the making of the laws.  So it is their interest that child slaves be born into the
world, and they will enforce the laws to that end.  When women have the knowledge of the
means to avoid producing hands, then will child&hyphen;labour cease, and the few children born to the
workers will be made welcome by society, and given fields and playgrounds in which to spend a
healthful childhood instead of grinding their souls and bodies into profits as is done to&hyphen;day.</p>

<p>A large family of children is one of the greatest obstacles for the working&hyphen;man and woman
in obtaining economic freedom.  It is the greatest burden to them in all ways.  No matter how
spirited a revolutionary one may feel, or what theories one may hold (it is usually the man
without a family who holds the most) the cry of hunger, the piteous pinched look of several little
ones, will compel a man to forego the future good of his class for the present urging need of his
family.  Sentimental, I can hear some of you say.  Call it what you will, responsibility is based on
sentiment, and if you would do away with it, begin by reducing the workers&rsquo; responsibility.</p>

<p>It is the man with a large family, who is most often the burden in a strike.  It is he who is
the most difficult to bring out on strike; for it is he and his who are the greatest sufferers through
its duration.  One could enumerate various instances where two or three groups of workers have
broken a strike, and upon looking for the cause you invariably found the men in these groups or
nationalities have many children, and could not withstand their needs.  So everywhere, the large
family is seen to be one of the multitude of miseries which to&hyphen;day confront the working&hyphen;class
man and woman.</p>

<p><title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title> told the working women these things and more.  It told
her the fewer children she had to cook, wash, and toil for, the more leisure she would have to
think, read, and develop.  That freedom demands leisure.  That the first step towards freedom
must be in the right of herself over her own body.  The right to say what she will do with it in
marriage and out of it.  The right to become a mother or not, just as she sees fit to do, and
certainly no woman should be made to become a mother against her will.  These \&ldquo;<soCalled>rights</soCalled>,&rdquo; of course, involve a special knowledge &hyphen;&hyphen; the knowledge of the means to
prevent conception; and it was the discussion of this subject around which the war on <title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title> was waged.</p>

<p>As Editor and Publisher of <title rend="slant(italic)">The Woman Rebel</title> I felt a glow of hope and
inspiration in the response which came from the working girls and women all over the U.S.A. 
For fourteen years I have been in the nursing field, and knew too well the intolerable conditions
among the workers.  I saw the women, wives of the workers, ask for this knowledge which would
keep them from bringing more children into the world, and I saw the entire medical profession
shake its head in silence at their demand.</p>

<p>I saw the women of wealth, the masters&rsquo; wives, obtain the same information with little
difficulty.  </p>

<p>I saw that if the working&hyphen;man&rsquo;s wife refused to have more children, she was compelled to
resort to abortion.  It is a rough estimate that over one hundred and fifty thousand abortions are
performed in the U.S.A. each year, and twenty&hyphen;five thousand deaths occur as the result of them.  </p>

<p>I saw that it is the working women who fill this death list, for though the master&rsquo;s wife may
resort to abortions too, she is given the best care and attention which money can buy.  A trained
nurse is called in attendance, and every care is taken that there shall be no evil consequences. 
The worker&rsquo;s wife, on the other hand, must look for the cheapest assistance.  The professional
abortionist, the filthy midwife, the fake and quack, all feed upon her helplessness, and thrive on
her ignorance and misery.  I saw that the Comstock laws produce the abortionist, make him a
growing and thriving necessity, while the law makers close their Puritan eyes.</p>

<p>I saw that it is the working&hyphen;class children who fill the factories, mills, sweatshops, orphan
asylums, hospitals, reformatories, jails and madhouses, because they have preventative
knowledge, and can use it, yet continue to pass laws that the worker should be deprived of the
same.  </p>

<p>I resolved to give my time and efforts to defy the law, not behind a barricade of law&hyphen;books
and legal technicalities, but by spreading the information directly among the workers in factory
and workshop.  In order to accomplish this result, I am compelled to flee to a place where I could
carry out my work unmolested.</p>

<p>When I have accomplished all that can be gained in this way, I shall return to take up the
legal end of the case.  But ever delighting in the fact, that, being deprived of my liberty, or the
companionship of those I love, the authorities cannot imprison my contempt for their stupidity,
nor deprive the workers of the knowledge they have received already.</p>
