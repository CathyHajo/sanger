<head>Woman And Birth Control</head>
<p><del>To me</del> <add>I believe that</add>  birth control is the <del>keynote</del> <add>signal</add> of a new social awakening.  To me it is not <del>only</del> <add>merely</add> an economic expedient, <del>but</del> it is also a <emph rend="uline(yes)">great</emph> social principle, interlocked with the <emph rend="uline(yes)">very</emph> spiritual progress of the
race itself and its future.  That is why it seems to me that this meeting is in harmony with the
basic idea of birth control, because it brings together all of us social workers of such diverse
outlooks and temperaments, which indicates that it is an idea <emph rend="uline(yes)">vital</emph> to us all.</p>
<p>I realize keenly that many of those who understand and would support the birth control
propaganda if it were carried out in a safe, sane manner, cannot sympathize with or countenance
the methods I have used in my attempt to arouse the working woman to the fact that bringing a
child into the world is her <emph rend="uline(yes)">greatest responsibility</emph>.  I know that <emph rend="uline(yes)">physicians</emph> and <emph rend="uline(yes)">scientists</emph> have a great technical fund of information. 
For years and generations they have had all the technical information on the subject.  There is
nothing new, nothing radical in the idea of birth control.  <person>Aristocles</person>
advocated it, <person>Plato</person> advocated it, all our great and modern thinkers have
advocated it.  It is an idea that must appeal to any mature intelligence, Yet all this scientific and
technical discussion has had the effect of producing more and more technical discussion, all very
necessary and very stimulating to that very small group and men and women who could
understand it.  But all during the long years while this matter was being discussed, advocated,
refuted by the scientists, the people themselves, the poor people especially were blindly,
desperately practicing family limitation just as they are practicing it today, but to them birth
control does not mean what it does to me.  To them it has meant the most barbaric methods.  It
has meant the killing of babies, infanticide, abortion, in one crude way or another, for women
from time immemorial have tried to avoid unwanted motherhood.  We all know the tribe of
professional abortionists which has sprung up and profited by this terrible misfortune.  We know,
too, that when the practice of abortion was put under the <add>ban</add> <del>of</del> the
church, the alternate evil, the foundling asylum, with its horrifying history sprang up.  We know
too that when the laws against imparting knowledge to <del>control birth</del> <add>prevent conception</add> were passed, <add>in this country</add> <emph rend="uline(yes)">thousands</emph> of women were forced into the hands of midwives and cheap abortionists unless they
would bear unwanted offspring, with the consequence that there is no other country in the world <add>today</add> which has so large a number of abortions nor as large a number of deaths
resulting therefrom as the<place reg="United States"> United States of America</place>. <add><del>No</del>
laws make crime to prevent by knowledge.</add>  It is a conservative estimate that 250,000
abortions are performed each year in this country, while about 50,000 deaths result therefrom,
and all this time our quacks and abortionists roll in wealth while our law makers close their
Puritan eyes. <add>Difference in B.C. & abortions</add> How often have I stood at the
bedside of a woman in childbirth and watched the tears flow in gladness and heard her sigh of
relief and words\ &ldquo;<q>Thank God</q>&rdquo; when she was told that the child was born dead. <del>What can man know of the agony of carrying beneath one&rsquo;s heart a little life which every
instinct tells the mother it cannot survive</del>,  For even when it is born <emph rend="uline(yes)">alive</emph> the chances are that it will die within the first year.  We know that there are 300,000
babies under one year of age which die in the United States every year from poverty and neglect,
while 600,000 parents remain in ignorance of how to prevent 300,000 more babies from coming
into the world the next year to die of poverty and neglect.  A few simple words of advice on how
to control birth would enable these people to <emph rend="uline(yes)">avoid</emph> this horrible slaughter!  In
my fourteen years&rsquo; experience as a trained nurse I found that 75% of the diseases of men and
women were the result of <emph rend="uline(yes)">ignorance</emph> concerning their sex functions.  <del>So great was this ignorance among girls and women concerning their bodies that I decided to
devote myself to the study of women&rsquo;s diseases.</del>  I took up gynecological and obstetrical
nursing and then I found <del>the great discovery</del> that knowledge to control birth was
obtained and practiced by the women of <del>wealth</del> <add>means</add> while the
poor women were kept in ignorance of this knowledge.  I found that these poor women had
emphatic views on the crime of bringing children into the world to die of hunger, and would
rather risk their lives through abortion rather than give birth to children they could not feed,
clothe and care for.  It is not <add>un</add>common thing to see <del>a</del> <add>many</add> group<add>s</add>  of women forming in line outside a doctor&rsquo;s office any
evening after working hours, between 6 and 8 o&rsquo;clock, on the lower East Side of <place reg="New York City, NY">New
York City</place>.  These women go there <del>and</del> <add>to</add> face the
tortures of abortion rather than condemn an unborn child to poverty, <del>and</del> <add>while</add> all this time our <emph rend="uline(yes)">wise</emph> men and sages and scientists are
discussing the subject of birth control among themselves.  Their ideas are sterile, <add>for</add> they have not influenced or effected the tremendous facts of life among <emph rend="uline(yes)">these</emph> women, the working women, the disinherited.</p>
<p>You all know the <del>life</del> <add>lives</add> of the children of the cotton mills
of the South, <del>of the boys in the mines ,</del><add>wend their weary way to work ,</add>of the children working in the canning industry <add>go carts</add> but do you know
that in New York City there are thousands of little infants between  <add>under school age</add> 3 and 5 years of age who toil far down in sub-cellars beneath the earth.  There they sit
cross&hyphen;legged upon heaps of rags, their little backs are bent, their faces bloodless, their little
fingers keep busy curling feathers, making artificial flowers, or rolling cigarets.  Year in and year
out they toil in places where the sun has never shone.  This work is <add>only</add> forced
upon them because they are <emph rend="uline(yes)">invariably</emph> members of large families who need
their pitiful earnings.  The same applies to child labor everywhere.  Statistics show us that the
majority of child hands of factories and mills of <place reg="Lowell, MA">Lowell</place> and <place reg="Fall River, MA">Fall
River</place>, Mass.  come from parents who average <emph rend="uline(yes)">nine living children</emph>.</p>
<p>We also find from records concerning the women of the under-world that 85% of these
come from parents who also average nine children, and later discoveries have found that 50% of
these girls have been found to be mentally defective.  Many of them at the age of 22 or 23 years
have the intelligence of child<del>ren</del> not over 8 or 9 years.  Can we not see how
difficult it is for this girl with <del>the</del> <add>an</add> adult body and child&rsquo;s mind to
compete in the struggle of life against the more intelligent and better born?  We know too that the
fertility of the mentally defective parent is four times that of the normal parent. In <del>New
York City</del> <add>all larger cities</add> today there are <del>10,000</del> <add>thousands</add> feeble-minded girls living in prostitution, clamoring at the doors of <del>charities</del> <add>the State</add>  to take them in and care for them and protect them
from the life of degradation which they have been leading.  The institutions for the feeble minded
are full and overcrowded.  There is no room for these.  Are not our feeble minded institutions and
insane asylums monuments to careless and reckless breeding?  Is it not time that our physicians,
scientists, social workers and sages, is it not time that they face this array of facts and stop
quibbling in hair-splitting debates over woman&rsquo;s morality.  I say this because you all know that
the principal objection in the minds of these people against the idea of birth control for the <emph rend="uline(yes)">working woman</emph>, is that it may have a tendency to decrease her standards of
morality.  <emph rend="uline(yes)">Solicitude for woman&rsquo;s morals has always been the cloak that authority has
worn in its age-long conspiracy to keep her in bondage</emph><add>!! suffrage &hyphen;&hyphen; young girl &hyphen;&hyphen; pest</add></p>
<p>When I was in <place>Spain</place> a year ago I found that the Spanish woman was far
behind her European sisters in readiness or even desire for modern freedom.  Upon investigation
as to the cause of this I was told that there are 5,000 villages and towns in Spain with no means
of transportation except donkeys over bridle paths, and that all attempts at building roads and
railroads into Spain met with strong opposition of the clergy and the government on the grounds
that roads and railroads would make communication easy thereby bringing the women of the
country towns into the cities where they <emph rend="uline(yes)">would become immoral</emph>!  Do we who
have roads and railroads think that our women are less moral than the Spanish women? 
Certainly not.  Yet we in this country are after all only just emerging from the fight for the higher
education of women which met with the same opposition early in its day.  We now know that
education has <emph rend="uline(yes)">not</emph> done all the dreadful things to woman that its opponents
predicted were going to result, and so shall we find that knowledge to control birth which has
been in the hands of the wealthy women of this country for the last 25 years, so shall we find that
it will not tend to lower their standards of morality, for if the women of wealth have withstood
this, <add>test</add>  have we <add>any</add> reason to think that the working women
will use it less wisely?</p>
<p>Statistics show us that the birth rate of any quarter is in ratio to its wealth, and further give
us figures to prove that in large cities the rich districts have a birth rate of one-third of that of the
poor districts. {In <place reg="Paris, France">Paris</place> for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 50
the poor districts yield ll6 births, while the rich districts yield 34 births.  In <place reg="Berlin, Germany">Berlin</place> conditions are approximately the same.  For every 1,000 women of similar ages there
are 157 births in the poor quarters and 47 in the rich quarters.  The same applies to <place reg="London, England">London</place>, <place reg="Vienna, Austria">Vienna</place>, New York, in fact to all large cities the world over,
which can be inferred that one class of women use means to control birth which is condemned
when taught to the other class.}  But the menace of our civilization and problems of today are not
the stationary birth rate among the upper class as much as the tremendous increase of the poor
and diseased population of this country. </p>
<p><del>Many of my friends will object to this statement because it seems to clash with their
economic theories, but there are always objections from some quarter; for every ideal created
there is a Herod born to kill it.</del></p>
<p>To me the question of birth control is by far the most important question that the working
people can touch upon, and it should have gone hand in hand with labor organization for the past
25 years.  Had this been done we should not have had to face the great problems of
unemployment and child labor which we are facing today.  It has been my experience that the
woman with an income of $10. a week does not desire a large family.  I have worked among
thousands of them.  I have found them with 7, 8 and 9 living children, and I have never yet
known one of them to desire another mouth to feed.  On the contrary I have found them in
constant terror of the coming of another baby and submitting to unwanted childbirth only
because<emph rend="uline(yes)"> of their ignorance</emph>.  Picture a woman with five or six little ones living
on the average workingman&rsquo;s wage of $ 10. a week.  Another baby is coming as fast as nature
can manage it.  She is already broken in health and spirit, a shadow of the lovely woman she
once was.  Where is the man or woman who would reproach me for trying to put into this
woman&rsquo;s hands knowledge to prevent giving birth to any more? {Is this action on my part to be
called immoral?  Am I to be persecuted and classed as immoral because I advocate small families
for the working women while Mr. <person reg="Theodore Roosevelt">Roosevelt</person> can go up and down the
length of the land shouting and urging this class of women to have large families and is neither
arrested nor molested, but considered by all society as highly moral?}<del> But I ask you
which is the more moral, to urge a working woman to have only those children she desires and
can support or to delude her into bearing cannon fodder for the munition makers and professional
jingoes?  </del>Let us ask ourselves which is America&rsquo;s definition of morality.</p>
<p>We in America are inclined to think that all advanced ideas must come from <place>Europe</place>, but it is interesting to find in my studies abroad that the idea of birth control as
it is propagated today <emph rend="uline(yes)">throughout the world</emph> had its <del>incentive</del> <add>impetus</add> from a book written in America.  This book was called \&ldquo;<title>The
Fruits of Philosophy</title>&rdquo; and was written by Dr. <person>Chas.  Knowlton</person> of <place reg="Boston, MA">Boston</place>, Mass.  over 80 years ago. <add>It was driven out of U.S.A &</add>  It wandered about the globe for 40 years before it finally found its way into a book
seller&rsquo;s shop in <place reg="Bristol, England">Bristol</place>, England.  The book seller was arrested for selling it
and pled guilty to the charge. <person>Annie Besant</person> and <person>Charles
Bradlaugh</person>, two ardent advocates of liberty, took the case out of the book seller&rsquo;s
hands and fought it out in the English courts.  Previous to this time there had been a great deal of
agitation on the small family question by the followers of <person reg="Thomas Malthus">Malthus</person>.  The
Malthusian advocates believed in small families but the methods advanced for bringing about
this result were continence and late marriage.  Dr. Knowlton&rsquo;s book, taking into consideration
the normal nature of man, advised on the contrary <emph rend="uline(yes)">early marriage with means to control
birth</emph>, which coming at the time it did appealed to the reason of a more advanced
generation.  The trial of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Bradlaugh aroused all <place>England</place>
and every lover of liberty came to their support.  The trial lasted three days.  It was heard before
a special jury, <emph rend="uline(yes)">they were found guilty</emph> and sentenced to six months&rsquo;
imprisonment.  So great, however, was the agitation and indignation at this example of legal
censorship that the charges were dismissed on a legal technicality.</p>
<p>40,000 of these books had been sold through England for six pence apiece, and it was
brought out at the trial that the charges would never have been brought had the book been kept
within the bounds of the restricted class by a high price. <del>To what extent this trial of Annie
Besant and Charles Bradlaugh won for the English people the right of free press can be judged
from the summing up of Mr. <person>Justice Coleridge</person> on an obscenity and
blasphemy case two years ago.  </del>(Insert).</p>
<p><del>The English people had been fighting for 35 years to gain that decision.  It has not
been won without effort, struggle and sacrifice, for in England as in America the people
recognize that there is an ever increasing power in the state, the tendency of which is to decrease
the liberties of the people, and it behooves each generation to grapple with this power and to
challenge it if we would hold the liberties gained for us by our forefathers.  We must not expect
that these liberties will be given to us easily.  We must be prepared to take what each new
generation needs and fight to hold them.  This is what the English people have been trying to do. 
They have been struggling for 35 years to hold what Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh gained
for them through <add>that</add> prosecution and trial.</del></p>
<p><del>Unlike us, the English love for liberty is greater than their dislike of personality.  No
matter how much they may dislike a person fighting for liberty, they stand squarely behind him,
never giving the government an opportunity to silence a voice merely because the person behind
it has been unpopular or objectionable to certain elements of the community.  It has been this
spirit that has triumphed over the censors and has given far greater personal freedom to them that
we have in America</del></p>
<p>When I arrived in England a year ago I found the greatest interest among the English people
in our <del>Comstock</del> <add>Post Office</add> laws, which contributed to keep the
people of this country in ignorance on the subject of birth control.  To my amazement I found
that the same group of <add>conservative tho</add> ardent advocates of birth control <add>were</add> most enthusiastic and <emph rend="uline(yes)">overjoyed</emph> when they found that our
obscenity laws had <add>at last</add> been violated.  They at once went about to interest and
influence the support of every man and woman in England of learning and of high standing to
back me up in my fight for this freedom.  You all know of the letter written to the<person>President of the United States</person> in my behalf by these people, protesting against <del>the</del> <add>my</add> persecution <del>where this knowledge was concerned</del>
and insisted that we are the only civilized country in the word whose laws make it a crime to
spread this knowledge.  This letter was signed by such prominent men as <person reg="Herbert George Wells">H.G. Wells</person>, <person>Arnold Bennett</person>, <person>Gilbert Murray</person>, <person>Elmer Maude</person>, Edward Carpenter and many others, and a great deal of
interest was also shown in my case by <person>Bernard Shaw</person>, <person>John
Galsworthy</person>, <person>Havelock Ellis</person>, who wrote me, and all <del>seemed to take a great </del> <add>took an active</add> interest in the work which was
being carried on in this country.</p>
<p><del>In England  it has only been within the past three years that the birth control league
has been openly ably to defy the laws to the extent of openly giving out the information to the
people who requested it.</del> Up to this time and during all those <add>30</add> years they
<del>had</del> <add>have</add> worked among the educators only, with the object of
getting behind them so strong a group of men and women that the government would not dare
attack them.  In this they have been successful and now their object is to establish clinics among
the working women where knowledge can be given free of charge as has been done for the past
30 years in <place>Holland</place>. <add>working class untouched</add></p>
<p>Immediately after the trial of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh the same group of men
and women who had been interested in carrying on this agitation formed what is known today as
the English Neo-Malthusian League, which advanced the methods advocated in Dr. Knowlton&rsquo;s
book instead of the Malthusian practice as advocated by Thomas Malthos.  Their first work was
to publish a paper and to spread these ideas into other countries in Europe, and Holland was the
first to become interested in the subject and invited Dr.<person> Dryesdale</person>, the
president of the <org>English League</org> to speak at its Medical Congress in <place reg="Amsterdam, Holland">Amsterdam</place>.  The following year a league was formed in Holland and a woman
physician, Dr. <person>Aletta Jacobs</person>, opened a clinic in Amsterdam and announced
that all women who desired this information could obtain it from her free of charge.  This was a
daring a brave thing to do on the part of Dr. Jacobs.  She was maligned and insulted by the
members of her own profession, but she stood firmly to her principles and continued to do this
work among the women of Holland.  From that time on <del>a</del> <add>the</add>
number of clinics increased, particularly in the working districts.  Today there are <emph rend="uline(yes)">52</emph> such clinics, with nurses in charge, and the medical profession has practically handed
this work over to the nurses.  Birth control work in Holland is better organized than in any other
country in the world.  It is the only country in the world where the government has <emph rend="uline(yes)">not</emph> prosecuted those advocating the idea, with the result that the men and women with
ideals have been able to put their energies into the building up of the league instead of wasting
their energies and time fighting the government authorities.  Today the <org>Dutch league</org> has 5,000 members.  Practically every well known man and woman in Holland gives this
work his unanimous support.  They send out 7,000 pamphlets a year, in three different languages,
English, Dutch, and Esperanto, giving all instructions to control birth.  Although the work of the
league is not sanctioned by the government, it has behind it so intelligent and unanimous a public
opinion that the authorities <del>dare</del> <add>have</add> not attack<add>ed</add> 
it.  A few years ago it was given a royal decree by the government as a great public utility, and
the result of 30 years&rsquo; work has been that the general death rate of Holland has <add>slowly!</add> fallen to be the lowest of any country of Europe, while the infant<del>ile</del> <add>mortality</add> of Amsterdam and the Hague<emph rend="uline(yes)"> is the lowest <del>in</del> <add>of</add> any cit<del>y</del><add>ies</add>  in the world.</emph>  This is not
due to either the philanthropic societies or the work of the State. But it is purely the result of the
individual responsibility of the Dutch people toward their offspring.  Holland proves to us
beyond the shadow of a doubt that the practice of birth control leads to race improvement <emph rend="uline(yes)">instead of race suicide</emph> because the increase in population has accelerated as
the death rate has fallen.</p>
<p>This work has been mainly in the hands of Dr. and Mme.  <person>Rutgers</person> of
the Hague.  This little man and woman have devoted their entire lives to spreading this
information among the people, and also to teaching the nurses how to carry on this work of the
care and hygiene of the human body.  To me Dr. and Mme.  Rutgers are more important to the
welfare of the Dutch people than either the king or the queen <add>of Holland</add>.  All the
nurses who are sent out to do this work are instructed by Dr. Rutgers and from him take their
course of training.  He then sends them into the district where they are most needed.  He holds in
his hands the records of the birth and death rate of the various sections throughout Holland, and
whenever he sees that the death rate in rising he at once sends a nurse into that district to
establish a free clinic.  These clinics soon become self-supporting for the Dutch people believe in
paying their way as they go along and so open and frank are the men and women of this little
country concerning this subject that they would no more think of bringing children into the world
that they could not feed, clothe and care for than we would buy an automobile or a piano, or any
other luxury which we knew we could not afford to <del>pay for</del> <add>buy</add>. 
This instruction is given to every woman <emph rend="uline(yes)">married</emph> or <emph rend="uline(yes)">old enough</emph> to be married, with the consequence that the young people are able to marry early and
commercialized prostitution is practically unknown among them today.</p>
<p>In <place>France</place> on the other hand, although the knowledge of birth control has
been universally disseminated since the time of <person>Napoleon</person> it has never been
organized along scientific lines so as to benefit those who most need it.  The upper class women,
as in this country, have ready access to it, <emph rend="uline(yes)">while the poor continue to mul</emph>tiply
because of <emph rend="uline(yes)">their imperfect knowledge</emph>.  This leads to a high infant<del>ile</del> mortality, which rather than a low <emph rend="uline(yes)">birth</emph> rate is the real cause of the <del>decreasing</del> <add>stationary</add> population of France.</p>
<p>We in America should learn a lesson from this, and I would urge immediate group action
for the forming of clinics in the industrial centers of this country where the poor women are over&hyphen;burdened with large families.  Instead of our charity organizations, <del>our</del> <add>instituting</add> baby nurseries, Better Baby leagues, Little Mother leagues, which at their best
are simply alleviations for their present distr<del>icts</del><add>ess</add>, would it not be
better to help these women <del>and the most of these babies</del> to help themselves by
giving them the knowledge to control birth, thereby preventing their bringing into the world
children to fill the orphan asylums and other institutions of charity?</p>
<p><del>To me </del><add>Our present day</add> society and all its well&hyphen;intentioned
palliatives are in this respect like the quack who attempts to cure a cancer by burning off the top
while the deadly disease continues to spread underneath.</p>
<p>I have never felt this more strongly than I did three years ago after the death of a patient on
my last nursing case.  This patient of mine was the wife of a struggling working man and the
mother of three children.  She was suffering from the results of an attempted abortion performed
on her by herself.  She lived on Grand St., the main thoroughfare of New York down-town
Ghetto.  I found her in a very serious condition and for three weeks both the attending physician
and myself labored night and day to bring her out of the valley of the shadow of death.  We
finally succeeded in restoring her to her family circle.  I remember well the day I was leaving. 
The doctor, too, was making his last call.  As the doctor put out his hand to say good-bye to her, I
saw that she had something to say to him, but was timid and shy about saying it.  I started to
leave the room to leave them both alone, but she said \&ldquo;<q>No, don&rsquo;t go.  How can both of you
leave me without telling me something that I can do to avoid a future illness such as I have just
passed through?</q>&rdquo;  I was interested to hear the answer of the physician, and came back and
sat down beside her.  To my amazement he answered her question lightly and jokingly, put her
aside by telling her that there was nothing that she could do as long as there were laws upon the
statute books, and he advised her to get her husband to change the laws.</p>
<p>Three months later I was aroused from my sleep at midnight.  A telephone call from the
husband of the same woman, requested me to come immediately, that she was dangerously ill.  I
arrived to find her beyond relief.  Another conception had forced her into the hands of a cheap
abortionist and she died at 4 o&rsquo;clock the same morning, leaving behind her three little children
and the frantic, helpless husband.</p>
<p>I arrived home as the sun was coming up from the roofs of that human beehive and I
realized how futile <emph rend="uline(yes)">my</emph> efforts and <emph rend="uline(yes)">my</emph> work had been.  I,
too, like the philanthropist, the social worker and the quack had been dealing with the symptoms
rather than the disease.  I threw my nursing bag into the corner and announced to my family that
I would never take it up again, that I would never take another case until I had made it possible
for the working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth.  I decided I had no <emph rend="uline(yes)">moral</emph> right to respect a law, &hyphen;&hyphen; a worn out piece of parchment, &hyphen;&hyphen; obsolete in
every respect, I had no right to respect this above human life, and I decided to violate it
wholesale.  I found to my surprise that there was almost no scientific knowledge available on this
subject in this country.  I decided to go abroad to study the question there.</p>
<p>My first stop was at <place reg="Glasgow, Irland">Glasgow</place>, where I went to find out what municipal
ownership had done for the women and children of Glasgow, and I found that every advantage
advanced through this administration were all of benefit to those who had small families.  For
instance, the model tenement houses owned by the municipality were built for those not having
more than two or three children, while the men and women who had five, six, nine or ten
children were compelled to live in the outskirts of the city, and huddled in the surroundings of
their industry.  It was the same with every other advantage to be gained through municipal
ownership, and when I saw the women with shawls over their heads, <del>a</del> bab<del>y</del><add>ies</add> in their arms and two or three little ones dragging at their skirts,
walking through the streets at <emph rend="uline(yes)">midnight</emph> calling and chanting the cry of help
and asking for bread, my heart failed me with courage to remain longer in this <emph rend="uline(yes)">model</emph> city, and I left to investigate conditions in France.  There I found that the women of
France, as in Holland, had done <emph rend="uline(yes)">more</emph> for themselves in five years through the
knowledge of birth control than municipal ownership had done in twenty years&rsquo; time for the
women of Glasgow!!</p>
<p>I hurried back to America to urge women here to help me to do this important work.  I
asked several prominent women, suffragists, feminists, and others, whom I knew not only
believe in the idea of birth control but practiced it.  I requested these women to help me to do this
work which I thought would strike at the root of the evil.  I tried to get fifty women to go on
record with me to make a test case in the courts but I was told to wait until we got the vote, I was
told to wait until I became better known, but the cries of thousands of suffering women would
not let me wait.</p>
<p>I started to publish the Woman Rebel.  I am not going to take up your time to tell you about
it.  You all know of its brief existence.  They tell me that it was too radical, badly written,
hysterical, defiant, to all of which I plead guilty, but as I became more and more convinced of the
necessity of birth control I felt myself in the position of one who has discovered that <del>the</del><add>a</add>  house is on fire and I found it was up to me shout out the warning. 
Should we criticise the tone of the voice which shouts out the alarm?  I might have taken up the
policy of safety, sanity and conservatism, but would I have gotten a hearing?  Is there not a great
deal in the theory in all modern life that if one desires bread you must <del>make a demand</del><add>ask</add> for cake?  This was my <del>belief</del> <add>theory</add>
when I started<del> to edit and</del> publish the Woman Rebel.</p>
<p>It was necessary in order to bring the attention of the people to this <del>issue and to its</del> necessity to make the demand so flamboyant that it would arouse attention and interest. 
You know of the suppression and confiscation by the post office authorities.  You know of the
indictments handed down by the Grand Jury against me.  You know that many postponements of
my trial and the final dismissal of the case by the government, and I am reluctant to call it a
victory, for what has victory meant to me in this case.  It has meant months and months of
persecution by spies and detectives, prying into every phase of my activity, coming into my
home in the guise of comrades and friends.  It has meant the exertion of the meanest and most
despicable methods in trying to suppress the message of birth control, as it has meant the opening
of all my private letters and the invasion of every constitutional right which we are supposed to
enjoy in this country.  It would be impossible for my to enumerate all the hindrances and the <add>tricks</add> our benevolent government put in my way the months I was publishing the
paper.  Indictments were the last weapons in the strenuous <add>campaign</add> to stamp out
the idea of birth control.  I am <add>glad to say the very reverse of what was intended has
occurred for</add> the same authorities who two years ago adjudged me\ &ldquo;<q>lewd and
vicious</q>&rdquo; now pay me the pretty compliment that I am not a disorderly person, but why did
the authorities change their minds?  Because of the thousands and thousands of letters of protest
which came to them from all parts of this country,<add>and</add> <del>I</del> convinced
them that birth control is too vital a demand in the United States today to be suppressed through
the persecution of an individual, <del>which</del>  proves to us again that the courts, no
matter how powerful, cannot combat a strong and intelligent public opinion.  My fight with the
government has been to arouse interest in the subject of birth control and in this at least I feel I
have been victorious.  Some of us may only be fit to dramatise a situation to focus attention upon
objectionable laws then those more experienced in constructive organization can gather together
all this sympathy and interest which has been aroused and organize<del>d</del> and <del>educated </del><add>direct it.</add> The work now before us is to crystallize this interest
into action, not only for the repeal of the laws but for the establishment of free clinics throughout
the industrial sections of this country.</p>
<p><del>Can we not form here tonight a birth control league to carry on this work. Such a
league would be a<add> rallying point</add> for the progressive thought in this city and
would focus interest on the local necessity for this work.  </del><del>Such a <del>clinic</del><add>League</add> would enable the working women to help themselves and to do
away with charity, which at its best can give only temporary relief.</del> Birth control will <add>shelter</add> women from incessant child bearing.  This must be done for her before
she can participate in social life.  Through it will she triumph over nature&rsquo;s and man&rsquo;s laws
which have kept her in bondage, just as man has triumphed over nature by the use of electricity,
ship building, bridges etc.  Through it will she triumph over the laws which have made her a
child&hyphen;bearing machine and in her triumph over these she will not only free herself but she will
also free <del>her children</del><add>the child</add>, for in her own emancipation will be
that of the <del>children</del><add>childs</add>.  She holds them both within her own
hands.  In her triumph over these she will develop her personality and individuality <del>to</del><add> &amp;prepare</add> with man for the emancipation of the race.</p>
<p><del>In Europe they <del>tell me</del><add>say</add> that to some extent the
failure of the US. to produce a proportionate number of great men is a disquieting feature of
civilization. Two hundred years have elapsed since the settlement began to take permanent shape.
The population is now immense, The opportunities for education are unprecedented,Yet the
native born men of real eminence &hyphen;&hyphen; of world wide fame, are very few in number.</del></p>
<p>Hitherto the development of the race has been unconscious.  We have had <emph rend="uline(yes)">no</emph> <emph rend="uline(yes)">responsibility</emph> <emph rend="uline(yes)">for</emph> <del>the</del><add><emph rend="uline(yes)">its</emph></add> <emph rend="uline(yes)">right</emph> <emph rend="uline(yes)">course</emph>!  Now in the

let us fashion the human race with an <emph rend="uline(yes)">intelligent</emph> <emph rend="uline(yes)">consciousness</emph> & let us face the facts of this vital<del>racial & social</del> needs & stand squarely
to meet our responsibilities & Birth Control is both a social and a racial need.  Let us face the
facts of this vital need and stand squarely to meet our responsibilities.</p>
<p>Birth Control will free the woman [torn page] it will free the child.  Thru it we shall
produce a race of quality instead of quantity.  Woman must triumph over the laws which have
made her a child bearing machine <add>bondage</add>.  Only in <gap reason="deleted"><supplied resp="MSPP">Thomas

man for the emancipation of the race.</p>
