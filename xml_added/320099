<head>Women&rsquo;s Naturalization Class.</head>
<p>Arrangements have been made by the <org>Naturalization Aid Society</org> to hold a
Naturalization Class for Women every second and fourth Thursdays at 8 p.m., in the rooms of the
Gaysville Forum, 1461 Third avenue.  The first meeting will be held December 14 and all
women who are not naturalized will remember this date and join the class.  It is free to you,
women Comrades; bring your women friends, become naturalized and be able to use the vote
when you are enfranchised.</p>
