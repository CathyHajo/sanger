            Sanger. The introduction by Mrs. Taylor of the Birth Control League
            of Alleghany County read: Margaret Sanger is the President of the
            National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, and
            Director of the Birth Control Clinical Research bureau, America’s
            oldest and largest birth control clinic. She went to India as
            representative of the Birth Control International Information
            Centre, London, of which she is also the President. <index

        <head>My Experiences in India</head>
        <dateline><place>Pittsburgh<reg>Pittsburgh, PA</reg></place>, Wednesday
            9 A.M.</dateline>
        <p>In India, where I spent a good part of the past year, there is a
            proverb: "<q>“Wisdom is knowing what to do, skill is knowing how to
                do it but virtue is in the doing it.</q>" As I go from country
            to country, from city to city, through the world, I am convinced
            that in America today we have the wisdom, the knowledge and the
            skill, in knowing what to do and how to solve our problems, but we
            do not have the virtue <add>that thing call it virtue, courage or
                    <supplied resp="MSPP">initiative</supplied></add> to do
            it.</p>
        <p>I was invited to come to India by the <org>All India Woman’s
                Conference</org>, representing between eleven and twelve
            millions of the most intelligent women of the Orient. I was greatly
            surprised that so many women in India spoke English and were well
            informed about problems which we in the West are so futilely trying
            to solve. I was also surprised to find that not onlyeducated
            Indians, particularly doctors and social workers, were willing and
            eager to find some way of dealing with overpopulation, but that men
            and women of all classes were pathetically anxious to learn about
            birth control. Women begged and pleaded for information about how to
            limit their families and space their children. </p>
        <p>This was not at all what I had been led to expect in India. People
            who claimed to be familiar with conditions, with whom I had talked
            before I landed in <place reg="Bombay, India">Bombay</place>, were
            pessimistic.</p>
        <p>“<q>Their religion makes it an Indian woman’s highest duty to have
                children,</q>” I was told. “<q>The more she has the better she
                likes it.</q>”</p>
        <p>One highly educated Indian man said to me: “<q>Why, <person
                    reg="Margaret Sanger">Mrs. Sanger</person>, you can do
                nothing. We all admit that birth control is the only answer to
                India’s population problem, but the women themselves don’t want
                it.</q>”</p>
        <p>I was sure they were wrong. I have always been sure that women in all
            lands and all ages have instinctively desired family spacing. I was
            sure that in a land like <place>India</place>, where you find women
            seeking a new freedom, economic and social, there would be thousands
            of minds reaching out to find knowledge which would mean
            freedom.</p>
        <p>So I said nothing, <add>but waited.</add> I wanted to learn for
            myself whether the women of India were so different from the women
            fo any other country in the world, that they wanted and would cling
            to endless childbearing if the way to voluntary motherhood were
            opened to them. </p>
        <p>Just two days after I arrived in Bombay I went to the
            “<q>chawls,</q>” the long rows of tenement houses where the city’s
            mill workers are crowded together in small dark rooms. Children,
            their naked little bodies bone-thin, played in the streets, or sat
            listlessly in the shadow of the buildings. Mothers stared with inert
            eyes. Almost every one had a baby or small child on her hip.</p>
        <p> I knew that of every 1000 children born in Bombay, 298 die. I know
            that it has been estimated that 100 of every 1000 mothers in India
            die in childbirth. I looked at these poor, worn out women, at their
            undernourished, undersized children.</p>
        <p>“<q>Ask this mother how many children she has,</q>” I said to the
            social worker who accompanied me, <add>and</add> pointed to a woman
            in a ragged sari, squatting on the street, holding a baby in her
            arms.</p>
        <p>“<q>Six,</q>” was the answer.<lb/> “<q>And how many dead?</q>”,I
            asked.<lb/> “<q>Five</q>”, she answered.<lb/> “<q> And how many more
                do you want,</q>” I pursued.<lb/></p>
        <p>She threw out her hands in a pathetic gesture. A look of fear came
            into her tired, lined face.</p>
        <p>“<q>Please God, no more!</q>”</p>
        <p> We talked to scores of mothers, some old, some young, and they all
            echoed the words, “<q>Please God, no more.</q>”</p>
        <p>No Bombay man can again tell me that women of this city, or any city
            in India do not want information which will free them of the dread
            of bringing children into the world to rob those they already have
            of food and clothing and care, of the very breath of life. </p>
        <p> Every moment <del>from my arrival</del>
            <add>of my stay</add> in India was crowded with meetings and
            conferences, with interviews and lectures. The problem was not how
            to meet opposition, for there are no legal restrictions, such as we
            have in America, and practically no religious opposition. The task
            was how to train doctors, midwives and nurses, to organize clinics,
            and put the movement on a firm, scientific foundation as a public
            health measure.</p>
        <p>Birth control is a burning question in India, and those best
            qualified to understand India’s problems are aware of this.
            According to Major General <person reg="John Wallace Megaw"
                >Megaw</person>, medical adviser to the <person>Secretary of
                State</person> for India, the population is rapidly outstripping
            industrial production and the situation can best be summed up in
            words “<q>They do not get enough to eat.</q>” Experts agree that by
            1941, when the next census is taken, India’s population may well
            number four hundred millions. </p>
        <p>Infant and maternal mortality are tragically high, but infant welfare
            work without birth control is making matters worse, for it saves the
            infants, only to let them starve later on. As in other countries,
            welfare work without birth control is dysgenic and chaotic, cruel as
            well as planless.</p>
        <p>I have attended many meetings of women in my lifetime, but the
                <org>All India Woman’s Conference</org> will remain one of the
            outstanding inspirations of my life. I found among these women an
            outspoken directness of opinion, a fearlessness in facing issues as
            they are, that we in America would do well to follow. The Conference
            passed a resolution in favor of establishing birth control
            clinics.</p>
        <p>The <org>All India Medical Conference</org> took definite action in
            placing the subject of birth control where it belongs, as part of
            the physicians program for preserving the health of his nation. It
            passed a resolution recommending that instruction in conception
            control methods should form part of the curriculum in medical
            colleges and schools and in the training of health visitors, nurses
            and midwives.</p>
        <p>I also lectured and showed scientific films which I had with me on
            the <title>Biology of Conception</title>, at the <org>All Indian
                Obstetric and Gynecological Congress</org>, the first of its
            kind in India. Indeed the movement got off to a good start in India,
            having the support of organized medicine, and of individual doctors
            everywhere.</p>
        <p>One of the highlights of my stay in India was my visit to <person
                reg="Mohandas K. Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</person>, and two
            memorable conversations I had with him. Gandhi has aroused the men
            and women of India as no one else has done, and the women of India
            wanted me to se him. He turned out to be even a better feminist than
            I am. For I believe that parenthood and marriage should be put on a
            fifty-fifty basis, that the man as well as the woman should have
            something to say about how many children should be brought into the
            world. But Gandhi would leave all this to the women.</p>
        <p> Mr. Gandhi and I disagreed with mutual tolerance, and I am glad to
            say, respect. “I think highly of your purpose,” he said to me in
            parting. “<q>May God guide you right.</q>”</p>
        <p>By the time I left India, fifty teaching centers had been
            established, and supplies had been distributed to public health
            officials and hospitals. My plan on leaving India in the same as I
            make here in America: Those in authority, those in charge of public
            health, those advocating the cause of social and mental health
            should take a firm stand and include birth control knowledge and its
            practice where it is desired and needed. This is a responsibility
            that can no longer be evaded or shirked, and one which the masses
            have a right to expect.</p>
        <p><add>It is gratifying to come to Wabash Bldg <place
                    reg="Pittsburgh, PA">Pittsburgh</place> to find there is
                also a center here where mothers can go &amp; receive from Doctors
                advice to space birth &amp; control size of family.</add></p>
