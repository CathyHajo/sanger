<head rend="case(allcaps)">An Evening with <person>George De Forest Brush</person></head>
<byline>By <person rend="case(allcaps)">Margaret H. Sanger</person>.</byline>
<p>In the course of a short vacation spent roaming about on Mr. Brush&rsquo;s <place>New
Hampshire</place> farm it occurred to me that the readers of <title>The Call</title> would be
interested in the social views of our premier American painter, George De Forest Brush.</p>
<p>The comrades are no doubt acquainted with his \&ldquo;<title>Silence Broken</title>&rdquo; and \&ldquo;<title>The Sculptor and the King</title>,&rdquo; the two Indian pictures which belong to the earlier
period of his career.  His \&ldquo;<title>Mother and Child</title>&rdquo; and \&ldquo;<title>In the Garden</title>&rdquo; of which the last named hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, exemplify the later
period, and together with numerous other masterpieces have established him as a world
renowned painter of the first rank.  It is interesting to note that the views of Mr. Brush have been
arrived at independent of past and contemporary writers, and therefore are the more interesting in
as much as they are largely based on independent thought.  An evening having been arranged to
discuss \&ldquo;<title>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</title>,&rdquo; by <person>Oscar Wilde</person>, I stirred up the fire, for the evenings are rather chilly up here, and we fixed ourselves
for the regular \&ldquo;<soCalled>wee hours of the morning</soCalled>&rdquo; chat, which Socialists the
world over take such keen delight in indulging in when ever they meet.  He had the book in his
hand and passed it to me, saying, \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">It&rsquo;s all so perfectly, wonderful, absolutely wrong.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">What?</quote>&rdquo;  I said.  \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Wrong?</quote>&rdquo;  W&hyphen;r&hyphen;o&hyphen;n&hyphen;g!  I could
not believe my ears.  An artist to disagree with this beautiful dream.  I could conceive of nothing
more fertile, no soil more adapted for the soul of man to develop in than this which Oscar Wilde
has shown us here.  </p>
<p>While I was thus wondering, I turned the pages idly, when my eye caught a pencil mark,  \&ldquo;<quote>Tut, tut,</quote>&rdquo; opposite the words of Wilde which said: \&ldquo;<quote who="WILOS">All
unintellectual labor, all monotonous, dull labor, all labor that deals with dreadful things and
involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by machinery.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Surely, this cannot be wrong,</quote>&rdquo; I said.  \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">You would not leave
man continue to do the laborious and disagreeable work which has so enslaved and degraded him
today?</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, his eyes sparkled and his whole countenance beamed as if he
were going to thoroughly enjoy his subject. </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Labor is the most delightful thing in the world when one does the thing one
loves to do,</quote>&rdquo; he said quietly.  \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">The whole outlook on labor is wrong today,
and it is because we have been so exploited through this labor that we have this repugnance
toward it.  When man labors for the joy of it, when everything he does will be a thing of beauty,
there will be joy in his labor.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Well of course,</quote>&rdquo; I said.  \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">if we were to all paint lovely
pictures and to make the ornaments of life beautiful, I agree with you, but there are the useful
things, the necessary things which I am sure there will be no beauty or joy in doing.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Can you name some such thing, some such labor?</quote>&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Oh, yes.  What about the building of roads &hyphen;&hyphen; the excavating, paving, etc.? 
There&rsquo;s not much joy in that, is there, Mr. Brush?</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Nothing more lovely in the world.  I&lsquo;d like nothing better than to build your
roads for you.  I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;d like you to make my roads, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d find the greatest
joy in making your roads.  When you look down from the Alps you ask what those beautiful
lines are.  You are told that they are <person reg="Bonaparte, Napoleon">Napoleon</person>&rsquo;s roads.  No machinery can
do joyful work,</quote>&rdquo; he continued.  \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">We must do things ourselves to accomplish
art.</quote>&rdquo;  </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">But what is the use of using up good human energy?  Why not conserve it for
more important work?</quote>&rdquo; I insisted.  He leaned forward and continued earnestly:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">And what is more important than making the whole world joyful and beautiful? 
For what else do you Socialists make so great and many sacrifices?  Why should the useful
things not be beautiful?  Why should it be as it is today? &hyphen;&hyphen; the really useful things are made ugly
by machinery and only the few things of life are beautiful.  That&rsquo;s all wrong.  What greater joy
could one have than to build beautiful roads, pave beautiful streets, build beautiful houses?  Of
course, if I had to build the usual modern buildings I&rsquo;d not find joy in that work.  When we stop
building up fortunes for the capitalists and work to produce art, I can conceive of no work which
cannot be both joyfully and beautifully done.  Art is the result of men working in unison through
ages.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mind had been wandering to the various departments of industry which today are
enslaving thousands.  I thought of the food question.  Surely, he would not have women again
enslaved in the household and white&hyphen;wash this crime by calling it the \&ldquo;<soCalled>art of
cookery</soCalled>.&rdquo;  \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Would he not hope to have our food prepared on a large scale
and thus emancipate us from this drudgery?</quote>&rdquo;  I ventured, bravely certain that here at
last he must acknowledge the necessity of machinery and the joylessness of labor.  \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Will there be any special joy in the boxing and canning of foodstuffs?</quote>&rdquo;  I asked.  At
which he burst out laughing.  </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Oh, you sordid American, if you&rsquo;re going to have canned food in your
Socialism I&rsquo;ll have none of it.</quote> &rdquo;</p>
<p>At this we both laughed heartily, and I agreed with him that I had indeed sordid ideas on
this subject, for I could conceive of nothing more welcome to the thousands of working women
than to have good pure food already prepared for them, ready at a moment&rsquo;s notice, instead of
spending a lifetime in a hot broiling kitchen doing the same work, getting the same result. </p>
<p>After I adjusted a log which had fallen away from its companions, he resumed:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">The trouble is with this generation, they have been too busy producing wealth
for others to think out a beautiful future for themselves.  What can a trade unionist tell us of the
beauties of our future?  His whole thoughts are industrial.  It will be for him to be served by the
artist; only an artist can prepare the feast well enough for him.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this mention of the word industrial I felt here was a large field which we should not pass
over without viewing.  </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Do you think there is any danger,</quote>&rdquo; I asked, \&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">of the present
Socialist movement, which is industrial in character, doing as the abolitionists did: after they
accomplish the ownership of the industries to rest their oars and feel that all has been done?</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">No,</quote>&rdquo; he said slowly but decidedly, \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">I do not think we will
ever go through that again.  That was where <person>Wendell Phillips</person> was more
farsighted than the other abolitionists.  He realized, though the black man had been emancipated
in the South, that here on our doorstep was the slavery of labor in capital&rsquo;s greedy grasp.  No;
when once the economic question is solved every one will have time to think, to advance and to
develop.  There will be beauties of the mind unfolded which never before had been conceived of.</quote> &rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">Do you think the master mind of each industry will hold office then, or shall we
have any office holders?</quote>&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Well, to me it is a waste of time to consider these things,</quote>&rdquo; he said.  \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">With man&rsquo;s economic freedom there will be a higher percentage of intelligence
developed, unrealized or unthought of today.  Just as machinery and electricity have permeated
the nation today, so in the future will it be universal knowledge to be skillful in the affairs of life. 
Every one will be a general.</quote>&rdquo;  He cited an example of the government&rsquo;s wireless being
interfered with, messages lost and stolen.  Upon investigation it was found some small boys had
rigged up a wireless on a vacant plot and were taking government messages.  \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Even
the youth of our day is permeated with invention.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">With the present tendency of State ownership do you think there is a possibility
of our being caught in the meshes of State Socialism?</quote>&rdquo; I asked.  </p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">I doubt it,</quote>&rdquo; he answered very earnestly. \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Why, look at the
rise of the labor movement in the last four years.  Look at the rise of the <org reg="Industrial Workers of the World">I. W. W.</org> 
Only a few years ago I was talking to a well known capitalist, who said: \&lsquo;<quote>Why, Mr.
Brush, the working people have us already.  All they need is a little more organization and we&rsquo;re
done for.</quote>&rsquo;  \&lsquo;<quote who="BRUGE">But the police are with you,</quote>&rsquo; I said.  \&lsquo;<quote>We
don&rsquo;t give that</quote>&rsquo; (snapping his fingers) \&lsquo;<quote>for the police power if the workers
were organized.</quote>&rsquo;  No, I doubt that the working class will let us drift into State
Socialism.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told me another story which, though it does not fit just here, is certainly too good for our
comrades to miss &hyphen;&hyphen; how this same capitalist, Mr. &hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;, said: \&ldquo;<quote>Why, Mr. Brush, there are
just thousands of people who won&rsquo;t work.  Do you Socialists realize this?</quote>&rdquo;  \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Yes, we do,</quote>&rdquo; said Mr. Brush, \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">and they are just the people we&rsquo;re after.  Why,
look at that <person reg="Lenox, James">Mr. Lenox</person> who called his son to his bedside and told his son
that he was leaving him a little farm which would enable him and his children to live their whole
lives long without every turning their hands to a tap of work.  The little farm was where the
Lenox Library now stands.  Yes, we Socialists know these fellows, Mr. &hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;&hyphen;, and we&rsquo;re after
them.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had wandered far away from Oscar Wilde, but again my eye caught a pencil mark near
the words: \&ldquo;<quote who="WILOS">A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament.  Its beauty
comes from the fact that the artist is what he is.  It has nothing to do with the fact that other
people want what they want.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">You agree with this?</quote>&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">On the contrary,</quote>&rdquo; he said, \&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">all great art came to be because
the world wanted a definite thing, and the artist, being commanded, produced a great result.  Art
is the expression of the joy of the people, and only a happy nation can produce art.  There is no
art today, for there is no joy in our people.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="SANMA">What about the Greeks?</quote>&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">Yes, indeed, they were full of joy.  They were overjoyed with life in
vanquishing their foes,  and gave the highest expression to art.  Why, the Greek women took the
keenest joy in combing their hair; it was leisurely, beautifully done, with all the new art of the
age.  It was never a new style, either; they continued to strive to make the old style more
beautiful.  They could not help making beauty in everything they did, for they were masters in
art.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire was burning low and he arose to go.  He extended his hand to my good night,
saying:\ &ldquo;<quote who="BRUGE">In my Socialism there will be no getting on without art, for every act of life
will be an emotion and every work a piece of art.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
