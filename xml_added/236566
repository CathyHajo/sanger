            <p>We are here today to discuss plans to effect the Amendment of a
                    <name type="law" reg="U.S. Criminal Code, Section 211"
                    >Federal law Sec 211</name>, passed by <org
                    reg="United States Congress">Congress</org>
                <add> Comstock </add> just 56 years ago.</p>
            <p>This law prohibits the sending thru the U.S. Mail of books,
                pamphlets, articles, records, charts, medical, scientific or
                data of any kind relative to <add>the</add> prevention of
                conception.</p>
            <p> There is no exception to the law, no exception to scientific or
                educational or medical literature no exception to Physicians or
                    <add>to</add> any group whose usefulness to society might be
                advanced by such information.</p>
            <p>It is said that the bill has rushed thru Congress on the last day
                of its session amid great confusion &amp; hurry--few
                congressmen knew the significance of the bill they had voted on.</p>
            <p>66,000 signatures were sent to Congress in protest of the bill
                immediately after but nothing came of it &amp; the citizens
                of this country have had to put up with bootleg information to
                limit the size of the family or resign themselves to the
                inheritable. <add>Here we began the first steps to effect the
                    differential birth rate. </add> It is estimated that since
                the passage of this law over <add>1,</add>150,000 mothers have
                died in U.S.A. from causes due to pregnancy &amp;
                    15<supplied resp="MSPP">,</supplied> million infants under
                one year of age have passed out of this life 90% of them due to
                poverty &amp; neglect.</p>
            <p>From 1876 to 1914 there was no concentrated effort on the part of
                any group to arouse public sentiment to change the law. It was a
                long period of arrests &amp; shameful persecutions on the
                part of the <org
                    reg="New York State Society for the Supression of Vice"
                    >Comstock Society</org>.</p>

            <p>When I came upon the horizon in 1914 I had seen such misery
                &amp; unhappiness among the overburdened mothers of the poor
                during my nursing work in <place reg="New York, NY">NYC</place>
                that I was convinced that our heavy toll of mothers lives--our
                maternal mortality could be lessened if sick &amp; ailing
                &amp; poverty burdened mothers, Tb &amp; heart &amp;
                kidneys could be protected from child bearing. </p>
            <p>I was convinced that our infant mort <emph rend="underline"
                >could</emph> be greatly reduced if our mothers were protected
                to space out babies--<org reg="US Children's Bureau">Children's
                    Bureau</org> of <place reg="Washington DC">Wash DC</place>
                <add>Where there is one</add> Interval of 3 years between births
                of babies There is a better chance of living than where only 1

                600 per m. 60% of 12 <supplied>children</supplied> die</p>
            <p>I felt that the legislation &amp; pallative efforts to lessen
                infant mortality were not enough. Child labor laws were not
                enough. If we are to make the world safe for childhood safe for
                future generations, safe for civilization then we must stop at
                its source the unending stream of death doomed infants thru
                birth control.</p>
