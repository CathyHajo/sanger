<head type="sub">Puberty &hyphen;&hyphen; Part II. </head>
<p>Beginning with puberty the eggs from the ovary are expelled as they ripen or mature.  This
process is called ovulation and occurs about every twenty&hyphen;eight days.  It is closely related to
menstruation but it is not menstruation as you will soon learn. </p>
<p>Some writers say the egg is expelled at other times than at the menstrual periods; another
writer asserts that one passes every six hours, alternating male and female.  There are many
views and ideas on the subject of ovulation, but I will tell you of the most generally accepted
theory, that the egg is expelled from the ovary every twenty&hyphen;eight days.</p>
<p>When the eggs ripens, the ovary discharges it and sends it on to find its way through the
tubes to the uterus.  Here we find the blood supply of the uterus greatly increased in preparation
for the egg.  We find the inner lining of the uterus becomes very soft and smooth so that the egg
can very easily find a place in which to lodge itself until it becomes fertilized.  We also find that
the cells swell and multiply, all in preparation to welcome and nourish the incoming egg or
ovum.  If the egg is fertilized by the male, it then remains in the uterus to develop.  If not, it is
thrown out, together with all the preparation made to receive it.  The cells burst and discharge
their contents; the mucus blood, cells and all come away in what is called the menstrual flow.</p>
<p>At one time woman was thought to be the only creature which menstruated.  But science
now tells us that all warm blooded animals which walk erect menstruate.  The discharge is
chiefly due to the position which in standing upright throws the large part of the uterus higher
than the neck.  In animals, such as dogs, cats, etc., the same process goes on, but the position of
these animals keeps the large part of the uterus lower than the small part, where the blood is
retained and then reabsorbed into the system. </p>
<p>This process goes on every four weeks in girls after they reach the age of puberty and
continues at regular periods as long as the egg is not fertilized until the reproductive age is over,
which is usually between the 45th and 50th year.  If, however, the egg is fertilized the menstrual
flow ceases and this blood supply goes to nourish the new life in the uterus.  It does not appear
again until after the birth of the child, and usually ceases while the child depends on the milk
from the mammal glands. </p>
<p>The age at which this process (menstruation) first takes place in girls differs in individuals. 
Climate has some effect upon it, for girls in warm or Southern climates mature earlier than in
colder places. In this climate the average girl reaches puberty at 14 years of age.  Some have been
known to reach it as early as the 11th and others not until the 18th year, in all in the same place
and yet normal and healthy, which shows there is no reason for anxiety if the girl does not
menstruate at 14, provided she is developing normally and is in good health.  During the first few
years after its appearances the periods are likely to be irregular.  This is because the sexual organs
are not fully developed.  Often the period does not occur after the first time for three, five, eight
months, and sometimes a year.  This irregularity continues for two or three years.  Cases of girls
coming from <place>Europe</place> have been known where the period was perfectly
established over there, but after arriving in this climate the menstrual flow did not occur again for
a year and over.  Usually this irregularity lasts only a few months, and once it has become
regular, there should be no worry over its arrival a day or two earlier or later.</p>
<p>The length of time the period lasts differs in women also.  The average length of time is
four or five days, yet there are women in which it lasts fully a week, and others but a few hours. 
The length of time should not be of as much concern as the amount of discharge which is
expelled each time.  It is, of course, difficult to estimate this, but physicians claim that more than
three protectives in twenty&hyphen;four hours should not be used.  In all women the flow is more profuse
during the first two days.  </p>
<p>The care of the health should receive more attention during the first two days than is usually
given it.  To the girl who has to work from early morning until late at night, these two days are
unusually hard on her nerves and on her general health, and I regret that I have no new message
for her to help lighten the burden, which under the present atrocious industrial system makes it so
hard for her.</p>
<p>Physicians say there should be no need of interrupting the regular routine of the day at this
time more than any other.  There are a few strong women to whom this period makes no
difference, but the average girl in this country spends two days of pain and discomfort. Out of
1,000 girls questioned, only 16 per cent were entirely free from pain, which proves that the time
has come for women to cease being ashamed of this function, and insisting upon at least one
day&rsquo;s  rest at the expense of her employer. Some of the old biblical ideas instilling into the man&rsquo;s
mind that a woman is unclean at this time has been the cause of much hardship and many sneers
endured by a woman during these periods.  The consequence has been that she will bear the most
intense pain rather than allow the men working with her to suspect that she is menstruating.  It is
all nonsense and wrong, and it is time women should band together in one great sisterhood to
protect one another from being slowly drained and exhausted of their powers of motherhood for
the benefit of their exploiters.  Women who belong to unions should demand that this day be
given them and their sisters.  Girls continue to suffer pains in the abdomen and back, pains
running down the limbs, headache, often nausea, besides being nervous and irritable, yet hang on
a strap in an overcrowded street car, stand or sit all day in the shop or at the machine and utter no
protest.  They know, too, they are not alone in this suffering, for they see about them day after
day hundreds of other women enduring the same pain, yet they remain silent.</p>
<p>How long will you endure this, working women?</p>
<p>There is one thing to remember, that the greatest strain comes on the nervous system at this
period.  One of the best ways to assist in building up the nerve strength is in sleep and rest and
for the girl who dares not remain away from the shop fearing to lose her \&ldquo;<soCalled>job</soCalled>&rdquo; the next best thing is to get to bed early, for there is nothing that builds up the
exhausted nerves like sleep.  Fortunately, the girl at school has some consideration shown her at
this time, and it is well that this is so, for until the period becomes established there is special
danger of overdoing in school work, which often causes St. Vitus dance and other nervous
disorders.</p>
<p>I believe firmly in the regular warm tub bath, or cold sponge followed by a good rubbing all
over the body at this time, together with nine or ten hours&rsquo; sleep, and light nourishing food
without stimulant.  If the bowels are active, it often lessens the pain considerably, and it is very
important that every girl attend to this if she has any regard for her health.  There are a few
abnormalities of the menstrual function which I will not take the space to state here.   Before
leaving the subject, I wish to impress upon the reader that most abnormalities, such as too little
or too much flow, or very great exhausting pain are usually caused, not by any diseases of the
generative organs, but more often a disturbance of the general health, which can often be treated
and cured by building up the system.</p>
<p>Every girl should learn the laws of menstruation and its hygiene and have a full
understanding of the same.  The menstrual function occurs only in the female at puberty, but at
the same time there comes to both boys and girls, or male and female, a mysterious and impelling
influence, which has great power over the lives of both during the adolescent period unless they
understand and control it.  This is known as the Sexual Impulse.  It is of this I shall tell you next.
