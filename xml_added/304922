<head type="sub">Sexual Impulse&hyphen; Part I. </head>
<p>The sexual impulse is the strongest force in all living creatures.  It is this that animates the
struggle for existence; it is this that attracts and unites two beings, that they may reproduce their
kind; it is this that inspires man to the highest and noblest thoughts; it is this also that inspires
man to all endeavors and achievements, to all art and poetry; this impulse is the creative instinct
which dominates all living things and without which life must die.  If, then, this force, this
impulse plays so strong a part in our lives, is it not necessary that we know something of it?</p>
<p>At the time of puberty there comes both to boys and girls two impulses &hyphen;&hyphen; one, the desire to
touch and caress; to come in contact with, to write and to speak to an individual of the opposite
sex.  This impulse is much stronger in girls than in boys.  The other is the impulse that impels the
individual to discharge the accumulation of ripe sex cells, and relieve himself of the nervous
tension which this accumulation produces.  This latter impulse is stronger in boys than in girls. 
One writer states that this is an unconscious desire for relief from physical congestion, not
differing greatly from the sense of relief which the emptying of the bladder or rectum produces.</p>
<p>These two impulses together constitute the Sexual Impulse, and this constitutes the
foundation upon which love, the greatest of all emotions, is based.</p>
<p>At the time of puberty, we learned from the last article, that the first manifestations of
sexual maturity in the girl is the appearance of the menstrual flow.  But also at puberty there
comes the sexual impulse, which evidences itself during sleep, in a filmy substance dropping
from the mouth of the uterus.  This \&ldquo;<soCalled>demunescense</soCalled>&rdquo; does not appear
very often in young girls, but later in life when sex instinct becomes stronger it occurs during
sleep, especially in young widows, or women having experienced sexual relations.  They are,
however, seldom aware of its taking place; consequently, it has not the danger which it presents
to the boy.</p>
<p>In the preceding article on puberty, we discussed only the girl at puberty, but here it is
necessary to understand that during puberty many changes take place in the boy, such as change
of voice, the growth of hair on various parts of the body, and most important, the discharge of the
sexual fluid commonly known as seminal emissions.  This latter symptom appears in every
normal healthy boy on reaching the age of puberty, but unlike the menstrual period which occurs
at a stated period in girls, the seminal emissions do not depend upon a special period; they occur
at different times, usually twice a month.  This expulsion is considered perfectly normal, and is
not a sign of physical or sexual weakness, but a sign that a surplus accumulation of ripe sex cells
are present and have come to their full development and overflow.  Nature takes care of this and
uses all of this life giving fluid according to the needs of the individual, casting off the surplus.</p>
<p>It is this symptom that alarms young boys at puberty.  It is this overflow which enables
quack doctors to play upon the innocent and ignorant boy, telling him that it is an indication of
weakness.  And it is also this &hyphen;&hyphen; as the result of telling older boys about it&hyphen;&hyphen; that leads boys to
houses of prostitution; for they are told by their ignorant advisers that they must have sexual
relations or endanger their sexual capacity.</p>
<p>It is also this overflow which, occurring in sleep, awakens the boy, and he is conscious of
what has occurred; he is conscious also of a pleasurable sensation which this sense of relief
produces, and unless warned against it he will try at some later time to bring on this relief by
friction or mechanical means, which is known as masturbation &hyphen;&hyphen; often called self&hyphen;abuse.  The
age of puberty is one of the periods in an individual&rsquo;s life in which it is easiest to acquire this
habit, in girls as well as in boys, although the girl may not be conscious of any sensation, through
the accumulation of the \&ldquo;<soCalled>demunescense</soCalled>.&rdquo;  Yet there is the same
nervous tension that exists in boys, due to congestion of the now fully developed genital organs,
perhaps slighter in intensity, but it is there and becomes conscious of it.</p>
<p>In talking to older girls about sex, menstruation, etc., she is often led into the habit of
masturbation.  Cases have been known where children formed this habit in infancy almost,
through the ignorance of nurses or even mothers, who, not aware of consequences, have kept
babies from crying by gently patting or rubbing the sexual parts.  It may be caused also by
uncleanliness, itching, tight clothing, etc.</p>
<p>When the habit is formed in very small children, it can be exercised in the very presence of
the parents, but they being ignorant of the habit itself, or the consequences, interpret the actions
as \&ldquo;<soCalled>baby ways</soCalled>.&rdquo;  Again, the habit is formed upon entering school.  It is
said no school is free from it; and it is a fact that no institution today is free from pupils who
practice masturbation.</p>
<p>In public schools are found groups of perverted boys and girls whose depraved ideas sooner
or later permeate the place.  A recent issue of a conservative woman&rsquo;s journal says: \&ldquo;<quote>In
absolute filth of conversation nothing could quite equal the talk of boys and girls during recess in
our schools.  What is still worse is that the child is generally instructed in masturbation,
prostitution and sometimes sexual perversity.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This subject of masturbation is at present under discussion from many points of view
among the medical profession; some claiming, that, as with venereal diseases, we lay too much
stress on the matter, and exaggerate the harm done to the individual by it.  One writer plainly
states that it is of such common practice that out of a hundred young men and women, ninety&hyphen;nine are addicted to it, and the hundredth one is lying.  Another says that out of a hundred men
and women arriving at the age of 25, ninety&hyphen;nine have practiced it at some time.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said to be practiced by people of nearly every race on the globe, and even by
animals when sexually aroused and their mates are not near.  By these examples such writers
would try to prove that because ninety&hyphen;nine people out of one hundred are not in insane asylums
the practice cannot be as harmful as is stated by others to be.</p>
<p>Let us take a sane and logical view of this subject and arrive at a decided conclusion.</p>
<p>In children before they have reached the age of puberty, prior to the development of the
sexual organs, it stands to reason that to abuse these organs before they are strong enough to be
exercised must weaken them for their natural functions.  Again, masturbation unlike the sexual
act, can be practiced individually and at all times and nearly anywhere.  This gives the individual
unlimited opportunity for indulgence, and consequently drains and exhausts the system of the
vitality necessary for full development.</p>
<p>In the boy or girl past puberty we find one of the most dangerous forms of masturbation,
i.e., mental masturbation, which consist of forming mental pictures, or thinking of obscene or
voluptuous pictures.  This form is considered especially harmful to the brain, for the habit
becomes so fixed that it is almost impossible to free the thoughts from lustful pictures.  Every
girl should guard against the man who invariably turns a word or sentence into a lustful, or
commonly termed, \&ldquo;<soCalled>smutty</soCalled>&rdquo; channel, for nine times out of ten he is a
mental masturbator.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest physical danger to the chronic masturbator is the inability to perform
the sexual act naturally.  The strong physical irritants which are used are likely to produce
catarrhal disease of these organs in both sexes, producing such irritating sensations that relief is
demanded, and this can be obtained only by repeating the habit, and so it continues.  The
individual promises himself over and over again after such exercises to overcome the habit, but
his will power gradually becomes destroyed and the impulse continues.  He knows and intuitively
feels such practice degrades him and destroys his character; he feels he is losing control of
himself, and also realizes that his health, especially his nervous system, is being undermined.</p>
<p>In my personal experience as a trained nurse while attending persons afflicted with various
and often revolting diseases, no matter what their ailments, I never found any one so repulsive as
the chronic masturbator.</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to fill page upon page of heart&hyphen;rending confessions made by young
girls, whose lives were blighted by this pernicious habit, always begun so innocently.</p>
<p>Before closing this subject, however, I want to tell of a case of an 8&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy I attended
during an attack of measles.  I found he was shy and unresponsive, and at times very nervous and
irritable, with a strong liking to be alone.  I observed him closely for a few days and reported the
results of my observation to the attending physician.  He was convinced of their truth, that the
little fellow was masturbating.  The physician assigned to me the task of talking to the child, who
acknowledged that he was \&ldquo;<soCalled>touching</soCalled>&rdquo; himself and had been ever since
he could remember.  The little fellow&rsquo;s mother had died when he was in infancy, leaving beside
himself a brother a year older with whom he slept.  I explained to him the danger as well as I
could and the result was that I was awakened in the night by whisperings and found the little
fellow asking the older brother to tie his hands to the bedpost.  This the older brother did with a
handkerchief, and the child went to sleep in this way every night during the few weeks I was
attending him.  The first few nights he was awake practically all of the time struggling to
overcome this habit, which he finally overcame completely.</p>
<p>At puberty every boy and girl should be taught these dangers and temptations and also how
to avoid them, by keeping active, mentally and physically, going to bed only when sleepy,
avoiding intoxicating drinks and stimulants.</p>
<p>We have strayed some distance, I know, from the beginning of our subject&hyphen;&hyphen; Sexual
Impulse&hyphen;&hyphen; to treat of its perversion (masturbation), but next week we shall again take up the
normal natural impulse and see what there is that every girl should know.</p>
