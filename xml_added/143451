<head>Wanted&hyphen;&hyphen;a Bigger Motherhood.</head>
<epigraph>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote>O friends & sisters gliding down the years 	Humanity is calling each &
all;  	In tender accents, born of grief & tears;  	I pray you listen to the thrilling call;  	You can not in your cold & selfish pride  	Pass guiltlessly upon \&lsquo;<quote>the other
side&rsquo;</quote></quote>&rdquo;</p>
</epigraph>
<p>Mothers of today <add>let us</add> keep that last line ever before our eyes.  \&ldquo;<quote>Pass guiltlessly upon the other side.</quote>&rdquo;  For as the children of today are the society of
tomorrow holding full sway over all&hyphen;&hyphen; we must stand back & view the passing generation of our
creation and we can not shut our eyes to the good or wrong we have done them.  Accordingly
shall we be judged.  Only a few days ago In talking to a farmers wife I was greatly impressed by
this attitude of \&ldquo;<quote>passing on the other side.</quote>&rdquo;  In relating some of the
experiences I had on the lower East Side in homes of poverty & sickness, where a father &
mother work side by side in the factory, leaving the family of five children to the care of the
oldest girl ten years&hyphen;&hyphen;the children remain in the streets all day getting their lunch as best they can
out of garbage pails or gutter until the parents comes home at night.  After I had related a few
such stories which had come directly under my care, tears glistened in her eyes, she drew both
her children close to her and said \&ldquo;<q>Oh City Woman I&rsquo;m so glad my children have their
mother, & good food, & plenty of air & sunshine, I&rsquo;m so happy that they are out of these horrid
cities & here where they can chase the butterflies gather daisies & romp & play to their hearts
desire</q>&rdquo;&hyphen;&hyphen;  She dashed a tear from off her nose, braced herself in her chair & began, &ldquo;<q>but after all it&rsquo;s no use in our worrying about these things, they are there & they can&rsquo;t be helped
& I just won&rsquo;t think about them.</q>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This good kind woman was as devoted a wife & mother as one could find today to her own,
but no other little waif ever stood even in the shadow of that love, she would not think of the
waifs so she \&ldquo;<quote>passed upon the other side</quote>.&rdquo;  Mothers of today is this not what
millions of us are doing.  Are we not afraid to meet the cruelties of our own neglect.  Are we not
afraid to face the four millions of little toilers returning at night fall <del>from the mills &
factories</del> with faces pale & wan & bodies bent and old, they have been making the
clothing for us, for ours, which gives us more time for culture & education.  They return old in
experience & weary with life at twelve years&hyphen;&hyphen; to their huts to eat their scanty food & throw their
frail & tired forms upon heaps of rags on the floor, to prepare for the next day&rsquo;s toil.  Are we not
afraid to face the thousands of little ones spending their daytime from sunrise to sunset in dark
cellars picking over old rags & doing so called \&ldquo;<soCalled>easy work</soCalled>&rdquo; emerging
at night fall thinly clad, tired & pale not a ray of sun to kiss their features for months.</p>
<p>Are we not afraid to face the thousands of \&ldquo;<soCalled>little mothers</soCalled>&rdquo;
ranging in years from 9 to 12 weighed down with the burdens & cares of the younger children,
shoulders bent & whole body tending toward deformity with carrying the little ones.  Think of
allowing the future men & women to be reared by children not much older than themselves&hyphen;&hyphen;how
many accidents is due this neglect.  How easily Society passes on the other side & smiles at the \&ldquo;<soCalled>little mothers</soCalled>&rdquo; & praises them, but does nothing to preserve their health
for the future big mothers.</p>
<p>Are we not afraid of the thousands of little girls whose power of motherhood has been taken
from her on account of diseases of gonorrhea etc. contracted in filthy toilets in the tenements. 
Hundreds of little girls contract this disease & are neglected&hyphen;&hyphen;mothers are away at work, the \&ldquo;<soCalled>little mother</soCalled>&rdquo; knows nothing of this ailment, and so the baby of three
years is being slowly eaten away by the dreadful disease and unless death relieves her she lives
deprived of the most beautiful gift of this life&hyphen;&hyphen;the gift of Motherhood.  </p>
<p>Mothers of today let us look at each other unmasked&hyphen;&hyphen;let us tear this mask of indifference &
hypocracy from off our eyes, & face these conditions & meet them squarely.  These children,
who work in the mills & factories, & cellars, these neglected & starved children of the slums,
these diseased & deformed children of neglect. <del>Even</del> the children who are pushed
about in the streets by every one, the children of the reform schools & jails, yes even the children
who walk the streets at night to sell their bodies are all ours&hyphen;&hyphen;they are ours.  Mothers&hyphen;&hyphen;yours &
mine.  Our sisters are their mothers they one & all belong to us&hyphen;&hyphen;for we are mothers of the human
race&hyphen;&hyphen; These children cry out to us for protection.  These creatures of our creation are the product
of our neglect.  And the time has come for mothers of today to face this neglect.  Children are
creatures of environment as all mothers know, and yet walk through the streets of any city from 9
am to 3 pm when the older children are in school & see what environment the children of today,
the men & women of tomorrow are spending their little lives, waiting for the time to go to
school.</p>
<p>From the time a baby can toddle from its mother&rsquo;s side until it&rsquo;s ready for the kindergarden
it receives its first lessons of life&hyphen;&hyphen;and thousands yes millions learn this first lesson in the street. 
There is no place for them, they are in the way on the roads, on the side walks on the steps in the
houses.  No place in this beautiful world of ours for God&rsquo;s most perfect creation&hyphen;&hyphen;little child &
our future Society takes its first lesson eating from garbage cans, stealing from grocers lying,
fighting, swearing, and we will wonder & exclaim as we stand back & review the passing people
of our creation, why so many are in jails & prisons, so many paupers & prostitutes so many
thieves & murderers and so <del>few bearing the flag of his country</del> many marred &
sick & dead&hyphen;&hyphen;</p>
<p>The problems of the children, of sex of education, in fact are all problems of life, are the
mothers problems and the mothers of today have been too long shifting her responsibilities on
her single sister & passed upon \&ldquo;<quote>the other side.</quote>&rdquo;  As the child of today is
molded that form will our future society take, and so will they call us to account for the neglect
toward them.</p>
