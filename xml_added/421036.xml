		<head type="sub">SUGGESTS PLANS FOR CLINIC IN BUFFALO</head>
		<q who="BCE">
			<p>
				<place reg="Buffalo, NY">Buffalo</place> will probably have a birth control clinic
				modeled after that in <place reg="New York, NY">New York City</place>, of which Mrs.
					<person reg="Sanger, Margaret">Margaret Sanger</person> is the director. Great
				interest in the project was evinced yesterday afternoon following the talk given by
				Mrs. Sanger at the home of <person reg="Rumsey, Susan Fiske">Mrs. Dexter P.
					Rumsey</person> in Delaware avenue on the work of the <org
					reg="National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control">committee for
					federal legislation on birth control</org>, and Mrs. Sanger gave suggestions for
				the formation of such a clinic. She advised first the formation of a medical
				committee with a lay committee to sanction the work, and she estimated that $5,000 a
				year would cover the expense of the clinic. </p>
		</q>
		<p>
			<q who="BCE">Mrs. Sanger, who has been called “the stormy petrel of the birth control
				movement,” and who is famous for her conviction that the growth of the population
				should be legally controlled fairly covered the case for the birth control movement
				in this country.</q>
		</p>
		<q who="BCE">
			<p> At present she is working for a change in <name
					reg="United States Penal Code, Section 211">a law</name> passed by <org
					reg="United States Congress">Congress</org> 56 years ago by which birth control
				information is classed with “obscene writings,” and can not be sent through the
				mails. </p>
		</q>
		<p> “That well-meaning man, <person reg="Comstock, Anthony">Anthony Comstock</person>,
			backed the bill when it was passed, and I believe that if Comstock himself saw the sum
			total of misery and horror that law has caused he would wish to have it changed,”<q
				who="BCE"> Mrs. Sanger declared.</q>
		</p>
		<p> “Populations have always been controlled,” <q who="BCE">Mrs. Sanger said.</q> “In the
			earliest days they were controlled by the methods of nature, pestilence, famine, and
			war; later unwanted children were killed off or abandoned. Now we know that these
			methods are not the methods of civilization. </p>
		<p> “We hope that we’re through with wars. We’re doing everything to keep the unfit alive,
			and our civilization is seriously threatened. How far are we going to allow the unfit to
			increase, the insane to return to their homes on parole, with no protection to society
			against their bringing into the world demanded offspring? From these ranks we’re
			recruiting the future generations. </p>
		<p> “How philanthropic we are, and, to a certain extent what miserable results we are
			getting! Nine billions spent on diseased, defective, delinquent, and criminal! If we
			could use those nine billions on normal, fit children we could surpass anything <org
				reg="Roman Empire">Rome</org> or <place>Greece</place> ever dreamed of.”</p>
		<p>
			<q who="BCE"> Mrs. Sanger pointed out that 90 percent of children who die in the first
				year of life die from causes due to poverty and neglect; she pointed out that,</q>
			“we are getting particular about the kind of people we are letting into <place
				reg="United States">this country</place>; the government has recognized that there
			must be a selective quota. </p>
		<p> “There is one class of people that has been controlling the size of the family, and
			there you see your best people today. In the other group you see every social problem
			entrenched, with all its hopelessness of life, inertia, and feeble-mindedness.</p>
		<p> “The better class of people will never be able to have larger families, and keep up
			their standards of living until you take the support of the other crowd off their
			backs.”</p>
		<q who="BCE">
			<p> Mrs. Sanger said that, while birth control clinics are legal under the state law,
				and may give instruction for the cure or prevention of disease, it is, under the
				federal law, illegal to send the address of the clinic through the mails. </p>
