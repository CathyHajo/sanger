<head type="sub">Sexual Impulses&hyphen;&hyphen;Part II.</head>
<p>In the first part of this article we learned that the sexual impulse is a combination of the two
impulses, the one which impels the discharge of ripe sex cells, strongest in the boy, and the other
which impels the individual to touch or caress an individual of the opposite sex, strongest in the
girl.</p>
<p>Every girl has in mind an ideal man.  This ideal begins to form sometime in the early
adolescent age.  He is usually distinct in her mind as to his physical qualities, such as dark or
light hair, or brown or blue eyes.  He is always a certain physical type, and often remains an ideal
to her through life.  At the forming period of the type she will be attracted toward many men who
seem to answer the ideal type, but as she reads and develops through the various stages of the
adolescent period, the ideal changes and grows with her.  As she reaches the romantic stage the
ideal must be brave, daring, courteous.  If she is inclined toward out&hyphen;door sports he must be
athletic.  And so it goes on until the twenty&hyphen;third year, when the average girl has a fairly settled
idea of the man who would suit her as a mate through life.</p>
<p>When the sexual impulse makes itself felt strongly in the adolescent boy or girl, they,
feeling satisfied with the physical beauty and perfection of the other, marry, they are unconscious
that the incentive to love when based on physical attraction alone is soon destroyed.  For
sickness, poverty or disease will affect even the most seemingly perfect physical attraction.</p>
<p>Let us not confuse the sexual impulse with love, for it alone is not love, but merely a
necessary quality for the growth of love.</p>
<p>No sexual attraction or impulse is the foundation of the beautiful emotion of love.  Upon
this is built respect, self&hyphen;control, sympathy, unity of purpose, many common tastes and desires,
building up and up until this real love unites two individuals as one being, one life.  Then it
becomes the strongest and purest emotion of which the human soul is capable.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the natural aim of the sexual impulse is the sexual act, yet when the
impulse is strongest and followed by the sexual act without love or any of the relative instincts
which go to make up love, the relations are invariably followed by a feeling of disgust.  Respect
for each other and for one&rsquo;s self is a primary essential to this intimate relation.</p>
<p>In plant and animal life the reproductive cell of the male is the active seeker of the passive
female cell, imbued with the instinct to chase and bodily capture the female cell for the purpose
of reproduction.</p>
<p>This instinct man, as he is today, has inherited, and, as with the lower forms of life, the
senses are intensely involved.  It is kept alive by the sense of sight, sound and smell, and reaches
its highest development through the sense of touch.  It is heightened by touching smooth and soft
surfaces&hyphen;&hyphen;which is said to account for the pleasure of kissing.</p>
<p>In the early part of this article I spoke of the desire to touch being stronger in girls than in
boys.  This desire leads a girl to kiss and fondle a man without any conscious desire for the
sexual act; whereas in the man, to be touched and caressed by the girl for whom he has a sexual
attraction, stimulates the accumulation of sex cells, and the desire for the sexual act becomes
paramount in his mind.  Many a young girl bubbling over with the joy of living, innocent of any
serious consequences, is oft&hyphen;times misjudged by men on account of these natural actions.  But
she soon puts on her armor of defense, and stifles and represses any outbursts of affection.</p>
<p>Society, too, condemns the natural expression of Woman&rsquo;s emotion, save under certain
prescribed conditions.  In consequence of this, women suppress their maternal desires and today
direct this great force into other channels, participating in the bigger and broader movements and
activities in which they are active today.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the type of the so&hyphen;called \&ldquo;<soCalled>old maid</soCalled>,&rdquo; so
characteristic of the generation past, has disappeared.  These great maternal powers are being
used up in the activities of modern life.  Instead of allowing it to remain dormant and make her
odd and whimsical, the modern Woman turns her sexual impulse into a big directing force.</p>
<p>That the male creature is the pursuer of the female in all forms of life, there is no question,
but that the female has the choice of selection and uses fine discrimination in her choice, cannot
be denied either.  This instinct of selection seems to lie dormant in women of today, for at
puberty nature calls to every girl to make a selection suitable to her nature.  Yet few girls follow
this instinct on account of the specter of economic insecurity which looms up before them. 
Instead of asking themselves:  \&ldquo;<quote>Are we matable and sympathetic?</quote>&rdquo; they ask: 
\&ldquo;<quote>Shall we have enough food, clothing and shelter?</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, girls, this system increases our degradation, and places us in ideals lower than the
animals.  All over the civilized world today girls are being given and taken in marriage with but
one purpose in view; to be well&hyphen;supported by the man who takes her.  She does not concern
herself with the man&rsquo;s physical condition:  his hereditary taints, the cleanliness of his mind or
past life, nor with the future race.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be a great change in Woman&rsquo;s attitude on this subject in the next few
years.  When women gain their economic freedom they will cease being playthings and utilities
for men, but will assert themselves and choose the father of their offspring.  As <person reg="George Bernard Shaw">Bernard Shaw</person> tells of her in one of his greatest plays, she will hunt down her ideal in
order to produce the Superman.</p>
<p>There seems to be a general tendency on the part of the Woman who is demanding political
freedom, to demand sexual freedom also.  When a girl reaches the age nearing thirty her natural
development tends toward sexual freedom.  It seems as though nature, knowing the time of
reproduction is drawing to a close, calls with all the fury of her strength to complete its
development and procreate.</p>
<p>It is at this age where physicians claim a Woman awakens to the sexual desire, and it is at
this age that women seek affection, or gratification with a \&ldquo;<soCalled>lover</soCalled>.&rdquo; To
her there is nothing to say; she is mature, developed and can judge for herself where best her
happiness lies.</p>
<p>But to the young girl at the age of say twenty, or even younger, immature, mentally
undeveloped, there is something she should know, and that is that every physical impulse, every
sensual feeling, every lustful desire will come to her whitewashed with the sacred word <emph rend="case(allcaps)">love</emph>.</p>
<p>Neither the boy nor the girl knows the difference between the sexual impulse and love.  A
boys meets a girl, he feels a great attraction for her, he feels the sexual impulse throbbing within
him, he is full of this life giving current he feels it throughout his being, he walks lighter and
straighter, he feels it in his voice, in his laughter, he grows tenderer within himself, and to
women.  He feels all this and is sure it is a love that will never die.  If there is an attraction on the
girl&rsquo;s part there is no difficulty in persuading her that this feeling <emph rend="case(allcaps)">is</emph> love.</p>
<p>But it is not love; it is the creative force of sexual impulse scattered through his being and
the sexual act brings it to its climax.</p>
<p>If motherhood comes to the girl through this relation, she has developed and the experience
has enriched her life.  But today the girl has an idea she has escaped the greatest disgrace when
she has avoided motherhood.  If the relation was based on physical attraction, a few abortions
and the monotony of every day life soon remove this, and the man goes elsewhere in search of
this wonderful sensation which he felt at first, but did not know how to keep or how to use.</p>
<p>The girl, however, has become a new being, sexually awakened and conscious of it.  But
ignorant of the use of the forces she possesses, she plunges forth blindly, with social and
economic forces against her, and prostitution beckoning at every turn.  So she soon passes with
the crowd on the road to the Easiest Way.  This is the story of thousands of young girls living in
prostitution.</p>
<p>Women should know that the creative instinct does not need to be expended entirely on the
propagation of the race.  Though the sex cells are placed in a part of the anatomy for the essential
purpose of easily expelling them into the female for the purpose of reproduction there are other
elements in the sexual fluid which are the essence of blood, nerve, brain and muscle. When
redirected into the building and strengthening of these we find men or women of the greatest
endurance and greatest magnetic power.  A girl can waste her creative powers by brooding over a
love affair to the extent of exhausting her system, with results not unlike the effects of
masturbation and debauchery.</p>
<p>Of course the sexual impulse is natural.  It is natural in animals, degenerates, and in normal
man.  But in man it is mixed with other essentials which, together, are termed love. These
essentials are derived from man&rsquo;s power of reasoning by which he is known as a higher species
and through which he differs from the animals.</p>
<p>When man emerged from the jungle and stood upright on his hind legs, the shape of his
head and his face changed from the long jaw and flat head of the animal to the flat face and high
head of the man.  All progress from that time forward was made along mental lines.  According
to the universal law then in existence he should have been limited to a geographical area and
killed by the extreme heat or cold or starved for one kind of food if it were not obtained, but
against all these he fought, because he became endowed with such attributes as reason,
knowledge and will&hyphen;power.  Instead of using his creative powers solely in hunting food and
reproducing his species, he used this force in making plans for his self&hyphen;preservation.  He built
rafts and boats to cross rivers and streams, he devised methods of clothing himself against
extreme heat and cold and discovered various ways of preparing food for different climates
suitable for his various needs.  In other words he conserved his creative force and redirected it
into channels which have resulted in giving him precedence over all other living creatures.  For
man has developed a <emph rend="case(allcaps)">conscious mind</emph> which asserts itself by reasoning, which
in turn has developed his brain&hyphen;power.</p>
<p>It is said a fish as large as a man has a brain no larger than the kernel of an almond.  In all
fish and reptiles where there is no great brain development, there is also no conscious sexual
control.  The lower down in the scale of human development we go the less sexual control we
find.  It is said that the aboriginal Australian, the lowest known species of the human family, just
a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development, has so little sexual control that police
authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets.  According to one
writer, the rapist has just enough brain development to raise him above the animal, but like the
animal, when in heat knows no law except nature which impels him to procreate whatever the
result. Every normal man and Woman has the power to control and direct his sexual impulse. 
Men and women who have it in control and constantly use their brain cells in thinking deeply, are
never sensual. </p>
<p>It is well to understand that the natural aim of the sexual impulse is the sexual act and the
natural aim of the sexual act is reproduction, though it does not always result in this.  It is
possible for conception to take place without love, it is even possible that there is no conscious
knowledge to procreate before or during the act, yet this does not disprove the fact that nature has
designed it for the purpose of reproduction, no matter what uses man has put it to today.  This
subject of procreation we shall discuss next.</p>
<p>Every girl should know that to hold in check the sexual impulse; to absorb this power into
the system until there is a freely conscious sympathy, a confidence and respect between her and
her ideal; that this will go toward building up the sexual impulse and will make the purest,
strongest and most sacred passion of adult life, compared to which all other passions pale into
insignificance.</p>
