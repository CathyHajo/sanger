<head>Laws Concerning Birth Control in the <place>United States</place></head>
<p><gap reason="missing" extent="one page">	Their only means of controlling the size of the <supplied resp="MSPP">family</supplied>
was interruptions of pregnancy &hyphen;&hyphen; often resulting in illness & death.</p>
<p>With my first call to the Nation that I was going to break the law, on behalf of these
women, I was overwhelmed with requests for advice & information, from thousands &
thousands of men & women throughout the country.</p>
<p>The problem was a natural one&hyphen;&hyphen;</p>
<p>It seemed to me then that the issue was one of free speech & for two years I carried on with
that idea in mind.  I was indicted for discussing the subject 9 counts when <supplied resp="MSPP">however</supplied> in 1916.</p>
<p>I spent several months in <place>Europe</place> & studied <add>the clinic</add> in <place>Holland</place>.  I came to realize that the best <add>presently known</add>
results in the technique of contraception must be obtained through individual application of
methods suited for the person in question.  This means clinics with medical men & women in
charge to effect new methods carried on by medical & scientific research.</p>
<p>Upon my return to <place reg="United States">U.S.A.</place> the Federal charges against me were dropped
& I proceeded to establish <add>demonstration</add> clinics & to organize all efforts to take
advantage of such methods as were legal in the various states.</p>
<p>There are now 25 clinics in U.S.A. legally operating under the state laws in which they are
located.</p>
<p>But the federal law impedes their progress because the use of the US Mark & Express
Companies is denied them</p>
<p>	Since 1916 when the Federal charges against me were quashed no change in the law has
taken place&hyphen;&hyphen;</p>
<p>	Through the efforts of the <org>V.P. League</org> a hearing was granted by <org>Congress Judiciary Committee</org> late Senator <person>Cummings </person>& <person>Cong Vail </person>introduced a bill called in the B.C. movement an \&ldquo;<socalled>open bill</socalled>&rdquo; simply removing the words \&ldquo;<socalled>prevention of conception</socalled>&rdquo; from the law.</p>
<p>The bill was tabled & never came out of committee </p>
<p>The organization which sponsored it soon went out of existence & that is the situation up to
the present time</p>
<p>During these years as <add>Pres of</add> the A.B.C. League <del>was</del> <add>we were</add> making every effort to change public opinion by lectures, writings etc
concentrating our efforts on State legislation for the provision & establishment of clinics.</p>
<p>After my <gap extent="one word">resigned as Pres of the League a year ago I was requested by the Illinoise
& California & Ohio Leagues to organize a National Committee whose object will be to <add>focus on efforts to</add> amend the Federal laws, leaving other Leagues & groups free for local
or State work.</p>
<p>This Committee will be one of individuals consisting of 1000 distinguished  endorsers &
523 Congressional chairmen.</p>
<p>The Committee has divided &uarr;the work of&darr; the country into four Regions, the Eastern, Mid
Western Southern & Western.  The subdivisions of Regions into Congressional districts with a
chairman & vice chairmen from each.  The<org> Nat Ex Committee</org> will consist of a
Chairman, Vice Ch, Treas Secty & the four Regional Chairmen.</p>
<p>Only 1000 people <add>wanted</add> to bring happiness into the lives of 120 millions.</p>
<p>While we can<supplied resp="MSPP">view</supplied> with satisfaction the work out the past 15 years
& speak with pride of our 25 established clinics in U.S.A.</p>
<p>Still to rest on the accomplishments of the past would belie our ideals & thwart our goal,
for so long as these laws besmirch our statue books&hyphen;&hyphen;they color our lives & insult our
intelligence.</p>
<p>So long as these laws remain they become swords over our heads&hyphen;&hyphen;clubs in the hands of the
ignorant opposition & operative against the poorest, most helpless classes in the country.</p>
<p>Our work is not done until these laws are changed.</p>
<p>Changed to allow our Doctors to send & receive not only information & data, but articles &
supplies from mfgs both here & abroad.</p>
<p>In <person>Arthur Keith</person> <place>Englands</place> leading anthropoligist
says that <add>of America its</add> \&ldquo;<quote who="KEIAR">the greatest experiment in race building the
world has ever seen</quote>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Is it not the spiritual responsibility of us who see this great human drama unfolding, to aid
in directing & guiding this experiment. Birth control movement forms a very large part of this
experiment. <gap extent="one page" reason="missing"></p>
