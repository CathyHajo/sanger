<head rend="case(allcaps)">A Question</head>

<P>The question has been asked: What would <title rend="case(smallcaps)">The Woman Rebel</title> do with <person>Rebecca Edelsohn</person>if she were in Dr. <person>Katherine B. Davis</person>' position?</P>

<P>No woman rebel would ever find herself in such a degraded position. The view of the
revolutionary woman is expressed adequately enough in other columns of this number.</P>

<P>We have no respect for the type of so-called \"<soCalled>modern</soCalled>" and
\"<soCalled>advanced</soCalled>" woman who becomes a willing and efficient slave of the
present system, the woman who curries favors of capitalists and politicians in order to gain
power and the cheap and fulsome praise of cheaper and more fulsome newspapers. If this is what
\"<soCalled>emancipation</soCalled>" means, give us the old slavery. As a matter of fact, it is
the most degrading form of slavery to be forced to prey upon the misery of others for your
livelihood. This Blackwell's drama should teach the suffrage advocates that they need expect no
loyalty from the renegade members of their own sex who sell themselves to corrupt politicians as
detectives, policewomen, and spies.</P>
