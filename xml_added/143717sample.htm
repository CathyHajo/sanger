PLANNING YOUR CHILDREN</h1></center>

<center>
<p><br>By Margaret Sanger</center>

<p>PARENTHOOD, when it is responsible, can be a noble trust, a proud commission,
an honored assignment. But this can be accomplished only by taking it out
of the sphere of accident and placing it in the sphere of conscious responsibility.
<p>When this is done every child will be a wanted child, born to its rightful
heritage of love, care, and comfort.
<p>Science has taught us how to take parenthood out of the sphere of accident,
how to plan for the number of children in a family, and the intervals between
their births. The idea that this should be done in accordance with the
health of the mother and the income of the family seems obvious. But our
adult world has been too dull, too timorous, and too bigoted to take advantage
of this knowledge. We have hedged it in with taboos and legal restrictions;
we are directly responsible for the present deplorable situation in which
the well-to-do can secure birth control information, but the poor who need
it most, are deprived of it.
<p>The Youth of America, and of the world, however, gives evidence of viewing
the matter more sanely, and more courageously. They apparently realize
that birth control, the knowledge of how to make parenthood a responsible,
voluntary trust, rather than a blind accident, is one of the most fundamental
issues before the world today. It can make or mar a marriage. It can, I
venture to say, help us solve our present tragic unemployment and relief
problem, and it can profoundly affect international relations and world
peace.
<p>"A century of stationary population," writes Professor Henry Pratt Fairchilds
of New York University, "would do more to promote the cause of peace and
prevent international wars than all the peace treaties and disarmament
conventions that have ever been signed, or ever will be signed."
<p>One of the most significant indications of youth's interest in birth
control comes from the office of the U.S. Commissioner of Education. In
connection with a nation-wide Public Forum project, a conference of youth
leadership, representing from one to one and a half million young people,
was asked to vote on topics for forum discussion. The question "Should
birth control information be permitted to be sent through the mails and
disseminated through clinics?" was given second choice out of 115 topics
and was placed first within its own category, Social Problems. Incidentally,
economic problems were voted first place in the general divisions and social
problems second.
<p>At present, as a result of laws passed in 1873 at the instigation of
Anthony Comstock, "the prevention of conception" is classed with obscenity.
The United States Criminal Codes make it a serious crime, carrying a penalty
of $5,000 or five years in prison or both, for anyone, even a physician
to send through the mails or common carriers any information or article
"designed, adapted or intended" to prevent conception. The situation is
further complicated and rendered paradoxical by the fact that the laws
of more than forty states permit physicians to prescribe contraception
to their patients. But how, may I ask, can a doctor prescribe birth control
if they are not permitted to receive data and supplies?
<p>The birth control bill now before Congress, introduced into the Senate
by Senator Royal S. Copeland of New York, and into the House by Representative
Percy L. Gassaway of Oklahoma, would permit the use of the mails and common
carriers for sending contraceptive information and supplies only to the
medical profession in states where physicians are already permitted to
prescribe contraception.
<p>This seems little enough to ask. The number of men in Congress willing
to support the bill has increased greatly, and this support is matched
by ever increasing numbers of individuals and groups in the public at large.
But the bill has not yet been enacted into law.
<p>In 1916 I opened a birth control clinic in Brooklyn, which was promptly
closed as a "public nuisance." In 1923, following a test case and a decision
permitting physicians to give birth control advice for the "cure and prevention
of disease," the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, of which I am
the director, was opened. It has functioned continuously since that time
and is now the largest in the world as well as the oldest in America. Since
then clinics have sprung up all over the country, until there are now approximately
250, taking care of poor mothers who cannot afford to go to private physicians.
<p>Splendid as is the work being done by these clinics, it is only a drop
in the bucket compared with what needs to be done. Every hospital and dispensary
in the land should have a birth control clinic. Birth control should be
part of the public health work of the United States government. Every young
mother, as part of her postnatal care, should be given scientific birth
control advice in order that her next child need not come before she has
fully regained her strength. Every newly married couple should have this
advice so that they can plan their family, allowing, in general, some time
to adapt themselves to each other before the coming of children.
<p>All this will be possible if the absurd law, placed on the statute books
over fifty years ago is changed. The bills now before Congress, Senate
bill No. 4000 and House bill No. 11330, should be passed.
<p>Some sort of birth control is being practiced everywhere today, and
will continue to be practiced, for birth control is here to stay. You cannot
get people to "unlearn" the knowledge that there is some way of planning
families. America's youth has a right to ask their parents, teachers, doctors,
ministers, and congressmen which is better; bootleg, uncertain and often
harmful methods promoted by commercial concerns for profit, or scientific,
harmless, efficient methods prescribed by physicians for the best interests
of young married people and their children.
