<head>The Fighting Women of <place reg="Lawrence, MA">Lawrence</place> </head>
<byline>By <person>Margaret H. Sanger</person>.</byline>
<head type="sub">{Note&hyphen;&hyphen;Mrs.Sanger was one of the committee who went to Lawrence to bring the
children to <place reg="New York, NY">New York</place>.&hyphen;&hyphen;Ed.}</head>
<p>To those who witnessed the scene at Grand Central Station, Saturday night, when the
children of the Lawrence strikers came from the trains, it was a demonstration not soon to be
forgotten.  </p>
<p>Thousands of men and women stood waiting for the little ones to come, and many had been
waiting since early in the afternoon, so when at last they did appear in the evening their
enthusiasm knew no bounds.  Shouting, cheering with tears in their eyes, hundreds of these men
broke through the ropes.  Tearing off their own coats they wrapped them around the cold and
ragged little bodies, placed them upon their shoulders, and marched on with the throng.</p>
<p>Everywhere were men with tears streaming down their faces, tears of joy and gladness at
this wonderful demonstration of working class solidarity; at this glorious slap in the face to
capitalists in general, and charity organizations in particular; at this great fact that no matter what
our nationality or creed, no matter what our methods of gaining our goal, the working class will
take care of its own.  Italian men carried Polish children, German men carried Italian children;
Scotch, English, Polish, Italians and French, were one and all carried upon the shoulders of class&hyphen;conscious men, who felt only that every child was a workingman&rsquo;s offspring, and as such has to
be tended and cherished.</p>
<p>The children of these strikers have been reared in an atmosphere of class&hyphen;consciousness and
solidarity.  \&ldquo;<title rend="case(allcaps)">The International</title>&rdquo; <emph rend="case(allcaps) ">is their song</emph>.</p>
<p>At <place reg="Boston, MA">Boston</place> while waiting for the train to New York, the French children
sang the \&ldquo;<title>International</title>&rdquo; in their native tongue.  After they had finished the
Italian children sang the same song in their language with fervor and emphasis.</p>
<p>So sweet were their childish voices, so fervent was their singing, that hundreds of people
gathered about them to inquire what this song was and the meaning of it.  </p>
<p>Here was the <emph rend="case(allcaps)">real</emph> demonstration, greater even of love, solidarity, class&hyphen;consciousness, heroism, self&hyphen;sacrifice than was shown at their arrival.  Mothers pressed their
children to their hearts, clasping them with all the tenderness and love of a mother king: kissed
them and passed them on to the train.  Every child a woman picked up to place on the train, she
kissed and caressed as lovingly as her own before it was passed on.  The French women
especially were  an example of heroism, devotion and self&hyphen;sacrifice.  Tears in their eyes, but
relief in their hearts, they waved their hands, shouted and cheered as the train moved slowly
away.  They were brave, they were firm, they knew the cost to them all&hyphen;&hyphen;should they lose that
strike.  Better anything than that terrible cry of hunger in a mother&rsquo;s ears.  Nothing is so sure to
weaken a father&rsquo;s resolve as that cry.</p>
<p>The mothers know this well, and were thankful and relieved that some of their children
would be cared for until the strike is won.  They all feel stronger in their spirit and more cheer in
their hearts to fight this fight to the finish&hyphen;&hyphen;to fight this monster who has been feeding upon the
blood of these workers, and is only waiting to feed upon their children as soon as they are able to
trot to the mills. They know what a future is in store for their children unless they win this strike.</p>
<p>One Italian mother expressed this in her broken way, saying: \&ldquo;<quote>Good&hyphen;a&hyphen;lady, taka
my boy&hyphen;&hyphen;by a by all happy.</quote>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the station at Boston an elderly man came up to inquire why these children should be
sent to New York City.  He informed a few of his listeners that \&ldquo;<quote>good old <place>Massachusetts</place> could take care of her children,</quote>&rdquo; and seemed incensed and hurt
that New York City should intrude to feed, and clothe the children of \&ldquo;<soCalled>good old
Massachusetts</soCalled>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A French woman who came down as far as Boston to assist with the children and get them
across the city on to the train for New York was also in the gathering and stood this just as long
as she could.  Then she turned on the poor old patriot with all the fierceness of a tigress
defending her young.</p>
<p>Over and over again, first in one language then another, they sang their song of <emph rend="case(allcaps)">international freedom</emph>.</p>
<p>The first plans had been that the parents bring the children to the large meeting hall at noon,
but upon later information it was found train connections could not be made to get tho youngsters
into New York until very late at night, so a change of plans had to be made.  Late at night men
and women were sent scurrying about from house to house to tell the parents of the change and to
bring the children to the halls at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.  For many mothers this was
impossible, and they decided to keep the children until a later date, when other little ones will go. 
Others, however, were so pressed for food and clothing that they were compelled to
accommodate themselves to these plans, and through the biting cold they trudged to save the
children from starvation.</p>
<p>At the hall the co&hyphen;operative kitchen was running in full blast.  Here the little ones has hot
milk and coffee, and what other food was available.  Too excited to eat much, their breakfast was
very scant, but large boxes of sandwiches and fruit were sent out by the co&hyphen;operative kitchen and
large cans of milk and coffee to be taken on the train.</p>
<p>At the Lawrence station many parents were already there with children.  Fearing to miss the
train, they did not go to the hall, but brought the children straight to the station.</p>
<p>Though it registered several degrees below zero, there were hundreds at the station to see
the children safely on the train.  Each child had its name, address, age and nationality on a paper
pinned to its cap or coat, a duplicate of which was in a book of the secretary.  Every child also
wore a white ribbon tied to its coat, which helped to keep an eye on them and distinguish them
from other youngsters, if the papers should be lost or torn off.</p>
<p>\&ldquo;<quote>Sure,</quote>&rdquo; she said.  \&ldquo;<quote>Good old Massachusetts!  ha, ha! 
Massachusetts send soldiers to shoot children&rsquo;s fathers.  Massachusetts say to fathers, \&lsquo;<q>You
work, work, all day you work.</q>&rsquo;  Fathers say, \&lsquo;<q>No more I work and children hungry.</q>&rsquo;  Massachusetts say, \&lsquo;<q>Then we shoot!</q>&rsquo; Good old Massachusetts, ha, ha! </quote>&rsquo;&rdquo; She snapped her fingers in his face and walked away.</p>
<p>Needless to say the reverend gentleman left the station rather hurriedly.  Perhaps he had
enough of such heresy, or perhaps he saw the glaring eyes and angry expressions of the men and
women who were anxiously waiting to express their views on the generosity of \&ldquo;<soCalled>good old Massachusetts</soCalled>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At any rate, there were several other patriots who also were there to defend his views, and
they had the benefit of these looks ans expressions.  But when the collection basket was passed
around these patriotic gentlemen could not be found.</p>
<p>It was surprising to hear the women of different nationalities,  Italians, Polish and French,
apparently unable to speak or understand English, when an opportunity came to defend their
class, got on their feet in a moment, and with all the bitterness of their hearts and the eloquence
of their broken English they put many cock&hyphen;sure gentlemen to shame at their own ignorance and
stupidity.  Always with fire in their eyes and courage and solidarity in their hearts, their English
served them well and had more effect on the listeners than the polished English of the educated
Bostonians.</p>
<p>These children and women of the Lawrence strikers could teach the working class of our
city much in the line of solidarity.  They breath it and act it and live it.  What could be grander
than that children be taught international solidarity?  The teachers of this spirit are fighting one of
the greatest battles of this day.</p>
<p>On with the fight, Comrades, you cannot lose!  </p>
