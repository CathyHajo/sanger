<head>Margaret Sanger in Japan</head>
<p>As soon as the Taiyo Maru came in sight of <place reg="Yokahama, Japan">Yokohama</place> and before I had
even a glimpse of the shore, I was overwhelmed by interviewers and photographers.</p>
<p>My first visitors with whom I was privately closeted for an hour were Japanese government
officials, stenographers and interpreters.  I was asked various questions concerning my visit to <place>Japan</place>, the reasons for my coming here, who my arrangements were made
through, how I knew these people, ect., etc.  Through it all there was a fine courtesy, and an
evident desire to ascertain the real facts underlying my visit, intentions and desires.  </p>
<p>I was asked to make a formal request to enter Japan.  This was to be made to the <person>American Ambassador</person> and the <person>Japanese official</person> despatched one
of his men to the Embassy to hasten the government&rsquo;s decision that I would not be kept waiting
longer than was necessary.  I was obliged to wait until seven o&rsquo;clock P.M., but in the meantime
my time was well occupied with interviewers and in receiving delegations from various
organizations and clubs.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting groups, who sent seven women to welcome me, represented the <org>New Women&rsquo;s Movement of Japan</org>.  These little doll&hyphen;like women came in native
costume to present their greetings and to extend their welcome.  Their pale faces, gorgeous
costumes, white stockinged feet, absorbed one&rsquo;s attention.  I felt I was being ushered into a new
world of womankind.  I was deeply touched by this representation, by their soft low voices, their
courteous bows to each other, bending from the waistline almost to the floor.  They said they
came to tell me that the women of Japan were in sympathy with the idea of Birth Control and
greatly desired to learn its methods.</p>
<p>I was also impressed by similar expressions of opinion from the reporters.  There were at
least forty to greet me from all over Japan, representing papers as far away as <place rend="Osaka, Japan">Osaka </place>and <place rend="Kobe, Japan">Kobe</place>. </p>
<p>Those who could speak English spoke for the others who said to tell me that the \&ldquo;<quote>government was acting against the popular opinion of the people in its attitude on Birth Control,
but that the people all over Japan were more interested in the coming of <person>Margaret
Sanger</person> than in the visit of the <person>Prince of Wales</person>.</quote>&rdquo;  We
all laughed heartily at this and I took it as an Oriental compliment.</p>
<p>After hours of interviews and flash lights, I was greeted by the returned official who
brought from the <person>Governor of the Province</person> a special permit for me to go
ashore.</p>
<p><person reg="Keikichi Ishimoto">Baron</person> and <person reg="Shidzue Ishimoto">Baroness Ishimoto</person> had already come
on board the Taiyo, as had the editors of the <title rend="slant(italics)">Kaizo Magazine</title>, under whose
auspices I was engaged to lecture in Japan.  They now took charge of my luggage and we &hyphen; &hyphen; my
son <person reg="Grant Sanger">Grant</person> and I &hyphen; &hyphen; were motored to the Customs House to have our
belongings inspected.  One goes through various customs during one&rsquo;s travels, but I had never
had such an overhauling in my life before &hyphen; &hyphen; not even during the war in Europe did any
inspectors examine so minutely my belongings.  I began to think it was curiosity more than
inspection, especially when I had to explain in detail how I wore a string of crystal beads.</p>
<p>Some of my books were taken, \&ldquo;<quote>held while in Japan,</quote>&rdquo; but I expect them
to be returned on my leaving the country.  It was pouring rain in Yokohama and while I was
waiting for my bags to be piled into the car, several rickshaw men gathered around the car in the
rain and finally got one of their men to come up to speak to me.  He said \&ldquo;<quote>Madam
Sanger we likes your Birth Control ideas.  We poor working mens like that ideas much.  We
thanks you for coming to Japan.</quote>&rdquo;  The spokesman then produced a fountain pen and
paper and I had to write my name \&ldquo;<quote>for my&rsquo;s memory</quote>&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Needless for me to say I had been surprised when I learned from the <person>Consul
General</person> at <place reg="San Francisco, CA">San Francisco</place> that the Japanese government had issued
orders that my passport should not be viséd, and that I could not lecture on Birth Control in
Japan. </p>
<p>It is not easy to surprise anyone who had worked for long in the Birth Control movement. 
We get accustomed to the unexpected happening.  In this case, however, my surprise was real,
because I was led to believe by Japanese in the <place reg="United States">U.S.A.</place> that there was a general
interest in the Birth Control subject on the part of the younger members of the government. 
Then, too, I was under agreement to deliver five public lectures on the subject, with the <title>Kaizo</title> group, whose magazine stands as one of the most respected in Japan, and, as <person>Bertrand Russell</person> had visited Japan under the same auspices, there was
every reason to believe that the <title>Kaizo</title> group knew the laws of their country and
were acquainted with the possibilities and limitations under these laws.  </p>
<p>In neither of these assumptions was I mistaken.  There is a younger group in the
Government, and a very large group, resented by the minority, a military party.  Many of these
more progressive men came to the receptions and meetings where I was the guest of honor and
expressed their disapproval of the government&rsquo;s action, and also expressed their belief in the
principle of Birth Control and their desire to help forward the movement in Japan.  While these
sympathizers can be numbered in the hundreds, they seem to be powerless in special
departments.</p>
<p>I was desirous to find out the real cause of the objection to my speaking on the principle of
Birth Control, for I had no intention or desire to give the methods nor to treat that aspect of the
subject.</p>
<p>My first step was to see the Chief of Police, for it was the Police Department from which
the objection had come.</p>
<p>My intention was to call upon the Chief of Police the day immediately following my
arrival, but from the time I arose until late in the evening I was so besieged with callers and
reporters that it was impossible to leave the house of Baroness Ishimoto until the next day.  It
was amusing to me to find upon my arrival at the Police Department that everyone from the hall
porter to the interpreter seemed to know I was arriving, although I myself did not know when I
should be able to go until an hour before we started.  We were ushered into a special room and
tea was served, though it was only a little after ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>One of the attendants called my attention to my book, \&ldquo;<title>Woman and the New Race</title>&rdquo; which he said he had read with great interest and much pleasure.  He then presented me
with a Japanese translation of the book, much to my surprise for I had no knowledge that it had
been translated or published until I saw it in the Police office that day.</p>
<p>Soon the Chief&rsquo;s assistant arrived.  He greeted me in the most courteous manner and
apologized for the absence of the head official, <person>Mr. Yuchi</person>, whose arrival at
headquarters was uncertain.  Any message I cared to leave would, however, be delivered to him.</p>
<p>The interview last about half and hour, and ended by his saying that I would be permitted to
speak in private, or under private auspices on Birth Control, but it was not possible to discuss the
subject in public meetings.  I was to be allowed to speak publicly on any other subject I desired. 
Before I had left the room we were again photographed and interviewed many times.</p>
<p>Previous to my leaving San Francisco the press was full of the subject, and upon my arrival,
the discussion was in full swing.  Every paper throughout Japan had something to say concerning
the government&rsquo;s action in banning the public discussion of a subject of such popular interest.</p>
<p>The first public meeting was held at <place reg="Tokyo, Japan">Tokyo</place> in the Y.M.C.A. building. 
The subject was <title>Population and War</title>.  I endeavored to avoid Birth Control and
tried to show the cause of <place>Germany</place>&rsquo;s desire for war as a population problem. 
Most of the audience understood English.  The reception of the address by the audience was most
enthusiastic.  The press, too, was generous and fair.  At the meeting, when I began to speak, there
must have been at least twenty flashlights.  I never saw anything like the passion the Japanese
press has for photographing.</p>
<p>From that day on there was an address made every day and some days two meetings.  We
found it far easier to accommodate small groups of one or two hundred, and to discuss the
subject frankly, than to have large public meetings.</p>
<p>Among the groups where greatest interest was expressed, was a meeting the <org>Peers&rsquo;
Club</org> organized by <person>Count Cowamura</person>.  At no time in my life have I
given a more intimate address.  I can say also that it was received with the finest spirit of respect
and understanding and desire to know more.  It was one of the most encouraging events of my
stay in Japan.  One feels conscious of the position of women here.  The men do not seem to take
the woman&rsquo;s movement seriously, and the fact that men of all stations came eagerly to hear a
woman speak on any subject is considered a victorious event by the women here.</p>
<p>My lectures have been given before the most intelligent people in Japan.  The <org>Industrial Organization</org> consisted of men at the head of practically every industry in
Japan.  They gave a Japanese dinner in my honor and being seated on the floor as we were
seemed to create an atmosphere conducive to conversation.  The questions asked by these men
indicated much thought along the lines of population.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most enthusiastic meeting that was held was that given in the Imperial Hotel at
Tokyo on <date value="1922-03-20">March 20</date> th by a prominent commercial organization.  Again it was a
dinner, but not Japanese (\&ldquo;<socalled>foreign</socalled>&rdquo; so called here) and men from the <org reg="Japanese Home Office">Home Office</org>, <org reg="Japanese Foreign Office">Foreign Office</org>, and various other departments of the
government attended.  While many of them understood English, it was necessary to have Baron
Ishimoto interpret the address for me.  He did this exceedingly well and I considered this to be
the most important and successful meeting held anywhere.</p>
<p>The doctors of Tokyo, about one hundred, asked me to give an address on <title>Practical
Methods</title>.  The interpreter, a young doctor recently returned from America, was not very
good and I felt at a great disadvantage through the lack of a good interpreter.  The medical
association of <place reg="Kyoto, Japan">Kyoto</place> on the other hand turned out four hundred strong at only
a few hours notice and, in the midst of a national convention, filled the Congregational Church to
its fullest capacity.  The <person>minister of the Church</person> interpreted and did it
amazingly well.  All the organizations which requested me to speak before them were
represented by distinguished and prominent people.  They were all, except the New Women&rsquo;s
Organization, composed of the so&hyphen;called well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do.  This organization is the most advanced and
intellectual group of women in Japan.  Many of its members are working in various trades and
occupations.  The government fears a falling off in the birth rate among the well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do and
cultured, but so far in Japan this has not been the case.</p>
<p>	The following statement published by the <title rend="slant(italic)">Japan Chronicle</title> March 23rd
gives the case exactly: <quote who="JC">\&lsquo;The authorities have evidently got themselves into a hard
tangle over the question of Birth Control.  Mrs. Sanger is to be allowed to address private
gatherings but not public meetings.  That is to say she is to be allowed to address the well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do
classes, but not the \&ldquo;<socalled>lower</socalled>&rdquo; classes.  Yet Mr. Yuchi, the Director of the
Police Affairs <org>Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department</org>, stated to the press
that personally he thought there was every reason for encouraging Birth Control among people of
the \&ldquo;<socalled>lower classes</socalled>&rdquo;; what they were afraid of was that the propagation
of the methods advanced by her would encourage Birth Control in the \<socalled>&ldquo;well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do</socalled>&rdquo; classes.  Mrs. Sanger must feel very perplexed.  The only point which is clear is
that the authorities regard her as an inculcator of dangerous thoughts, but do not know exactly in
what way they are dangerous.  Evidently a case of intuition.  It is the opinion of everyone in
Japan today that Birth Control has been more prominently discussed because of the action of the
Police than it otherwise would have been.&rdquo;</quote></p>
<p>The two principal reasons I have been able to find, upon which the Police Department
based its objection were first, that the police in New York forbade my speaking in that city, as
cabled here concerning the Town Hall meeting on <date value="1921-11-13">November 13.</date>  They did not
hear that another meeting was held, or any of the proceedings which followed.  The only fact
which stood out prominently in the mind of these officials was that our meeting was closed by
the Police &hyphen; &hyphen; that was sufficient evidence to prevent such a meeting here.</p>
<p>Then the other reason is because of a pending bill called \&ldquo;<socalled>The Dangerous
Thoughts Bill</socalled>&rdquo; or \&ldquo;<socalled>The Thought Control Bill</socalled>,&rdquo; making it a
crime for foreigners to bring to Japan a <emph rend="slant(italics)">foreign thought</emph>!  This bill has not
been passes up to the present time, but it was under discussion at the time of my arrival and was
backed by the same reactionary group as influenced the Police Department.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Japan has now a <org>Birth Control League</org>.  It had for its officers
four most intelligent men representing four branches of civic life, Medicine, Science, Labor and
Commerce.</p>
<p>From Yokohama to Kobe, and again across the <place>Inland Sea</place> to <place reg="Fusan, Japan">Fuzan</place>, the interest has been tremendous and the reception accorded me has been
beyond my hopes or dreams.  The opposition of the government threw the sympathy of the
people with me and I believe I have accomplished more, established more centers and aroused
more discussion in one month than I could ordinarily have done in a year.</p>
<p>It is the general opinion that the agitation came just on time.  While women were slowly
advancing in emancipating themselves and labor also is just taking its first flight, neither of them
had included Birth Control in their programs.  Now they see their problems in a different light,
and by its general adoption will cut short their struggles and hasten their victories. </p>
